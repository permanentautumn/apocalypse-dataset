She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in,
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay,
She's answered by the tail lights
Shining through the window pane

He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said you're ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You gotta gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln,
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin',
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same 'ol light shinin',
He thinks of Colorado
And the girl he left behind

He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said you're ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You gotta gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

Born for leavin'

Well it's a winding road
When your in the lost and found
You're a lover I'm a runner
We go 'round 'n 'round
And I love you but I leave you
I don't want you but I need you
You know it's you who calls me back here

Oh I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
I gotta gypsy soul
And I was born for leavin' (born for leavin')

When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then

Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins, that do you in

You and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough
Never enough, you and tequila, you and tequila make me crazy

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied

Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin' heavier
I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight

Here we go again

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

We were sittin' up there on your momma's roof
Talkin' 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh, but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

So, we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said, "Say I do"
I did and you did too, then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Yeah baby, I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

I tell her “now goin’ pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I couldn’t care less
I’m in hell’s kitchen with an apron and a hair net
Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I’m weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I’m dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can’t see me, nose bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drumset
I’ve been at the top for a while and I ain’t jump yet
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me “baby, it’s real”
And I say I ain’t doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
But she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Yeah,

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

Yeah, I tell her “now go on, pop that pussy for me”
Haters can’t see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I’m all about “I” give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that “wine and dine”
Try to check me and I’ma have ‘em checkin’ pulses
They say choose wisely, that’s why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face South and her ass North
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me “baby, it’s real”
And I say I ain’t doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
But she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Yeah,

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

(Ladies and gentlemen, Drizzy…)

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me “baby, it’s real”
And I say I ain’t doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I'm get to it)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
But she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Carter 4 Tunchi Yeah

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain't who I wanna be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you

There's more here than what we're seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
Gave me you

Coconut man, moon head, and pea
You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that, yeah
We're paying with love tonight

We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only the one getting tired
Why is everybody so obsessed
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

Everybody look to their left

And a half stack
And you can, can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I, yes all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what, in thirty seconds I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on the life
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gonna stumble and fall never
Waiting to see us in a sign of defeat uh uh
So we gonna keep everyone moving they feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
It's not about the money

We'll just keep running from tomorrow
With our lips locked
Yeah, you've got me begging, begging

We'll just keep running from tomorrow
With our lips locked

Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't, baby please don't, baby plase don't runaway

Sittin' in six lane backed up traffic
Horns a honkin', I've about had it I'm lookin' for an exit sign
Gotta get outta here, get it all off my mind
Then like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changin' my mood, a little George Strait 1982

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two lane country who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road

I've been cooped up, tied down 'bout forgotten 
what a field looks like full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need the curvin', windin', twistin' dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowin' through my baby's hair

Yeah it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two lane country who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road

Maybe it's the feelin'
Or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot 
Where we park the truck when things get hot
Girl we park the truck when things get hot

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some two lane country who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road

Some old back road
Get back with my soul
All I gotta do is take some old back road
To the shady spot where things get hot girl
Way down, way down, way down some old back road

You make it hard for me to see somebody else
I'm calling her your name
Yeah its messed up, 'cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you
It's your fault babe
I never wanted us to break up
No not this way
But you don't understand it girl
When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex
With you I had a bad romance
And if I could, just trade her in I would
'Cause nobody can pass ya, no, yeah 

Think I better let her go
Can't leave you alone
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you
I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
And now I realize that she ain't you
(no she ain't you)
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
She ain't you, no she ain't you

I been sleeping out
For quite some nights now
It's not the same in my bed
But if she found out, what's going on in my head
It'll be all bad, have me right back
But you don't understand it girl
When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex
With you I had a bad romance
And if I could, just trade her in I would
'Cause nobody can pass ya, no, yeah 

I think I better let her go
Can't leave you alone
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you
I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
And now I realize that she ain't you

No she ain't she ain't you

Dayo, me say dayo,
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home

We drink the whole bottle but it ain't over, over
Everybody jumping on the sofa, sofa
Standing on the chairs,
Standing on the bar,
No matter day or night, I'm shining,
Bitch, I'm a star.

From the window (from the window)
To the wall (to the wall)
This club is jumpin' (this club is jumpin')
Til tomorrow ('Til tomorrow)
Is it daylight? (Is it daylight?)
Or is it night time? (Is it night time)
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
We gon' tear the club up (up,up,up,up)

I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer,
Told her and her girlfriends, lets sleep in my cabana,
Ask me where the party's at, baby I'm the answer,
Have another drink with me, shorty where your manners?
Take another shot, another, shot, shot, shot, shot
I can make it hot, make it hot, we go rock until the

What goes around comes back around
(Hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around
(Hey my baby)
I say what goes around comes back around
(Hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around

There was a time
I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy I, must've been outta my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good lookin' out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
You turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby good lookin' out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
I said you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Hmm, and I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place
Another time, another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Oh and I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh best thing you never had 

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Whoa, I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

(What goes around comes back around)
(What goes around comes back around)
Bet it sucks to be you right now
(What goes around comes back around)
Bet it sucks to be you right now
(What goes around comes back around)
Bet it sucks to be you right now

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, oh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know the game even got it like that
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind. (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know

Don't say a word just turn around and let me see
Girl you got some'n special, some'n special for me?	
It's way too many suckers in the VIP
Tell her got my car out front, tell me do you wanna kick it
In the backseat, I wanna get beside ya
In the backseat, so I can be yo' backseat driver
In the backseat, I wanna get beside ya
In the backseat, so I can be yo' backseat driver

Close my eyes, here you are all alone dancing in the dark.

To let my hands do what they want? 
Late at night I pretend we are 
Dance dance dancing in the dark

Open my body up and do some surgery, 
Now that you got me up I wanna taste it taste it

Wanna see who you are, 
Got a sex drive to push the start

On my waist, through my hair. 
Think about it when you touch me there.

All alone dancing in the dark.

To let my hands do what they want. 
Late at night I pretend we are 

Dance dance dancing in the dark

Dancing in the dark

We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you

Now we keep saying that we're OK
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then 
I wanna feel that way again

Been so long that you'd forget 
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire, so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me

Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night

Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and didn't just sleep
Remind me baby remind me

Oh so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me, baby remind me

I wanna feel that way
Yeah I wanna hold you close
Oh if you still love me
Don't just assume I know

Oh baby remind me, remind me

Do you remember the way it felt?
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me, yeah remind me

All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh baby remind me

Yeah you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me, oh baby remind me yeah
Oh baby remind me baby remind me

Yeah you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
Oh, baby remind me

Hey girl, go on now!
You know you've got everybody lookin'

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate
Girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Aw, country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me

Sombody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony-tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me

Guitar!

Now dance, like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines
Yeah, move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you 
And get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you 
And get to lovin' you 
'Fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me

Gonna put the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought it
Now I'm lost in the world tryin' to find me a better way

Wishin' I was
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky, breeze and it don't seem fair
The only worry in the world
Is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note, said "Be back in a minute"
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishin' my condition ain't ever gonna go away

'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair
Only worry in the world
Is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore watchin' over me
It's a sweet sweet life livin' by the salty sea
One day you can be as lost as me
Change your geography and maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair
Only worry in the world
Is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Come on in
The waters nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack
Otherwise you'll never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find a key to paradise

A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water, we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold

Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

(Whoa-oh)
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star 
So, I grabbed a beer and an old guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

(Whoa-oh)
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night

Whoa-oh, never gonna grow up, ha
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night

(Whoa-oh) 
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night

I wouldn't wanna be anybody else.
You made me insecure
Told me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else

Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na
Na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus]
Who says
Who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me
That's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful
Who says

It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It's like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky

Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na
Na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life

Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting

That's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful
Who says

Who says
Who says you're not star potential
Who says you're not presidential
Who says you can't be in movies
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test
Who says you can't be the best
Who said, who said
Would you tell me who said that
Yeah, oh
Who says

Who says
Who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me

Baby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We're gonna do what lovers do
We're gonna have a fight or two
But I ain't ever changing my mind

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like crazy, girl?

I wouldn't last a single day
I'd probably just fade away
Without you I'd lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was living life all wrong
The smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman, come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like crazy, girl?
Like crazy, girl

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like crazy, girl?

Like crazy
Oh crazy girl
Like crazy
Oh crazy girl

You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down

Before you met me 
I was alright but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe this, is, real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe this, is, real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight

Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight 
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight

Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight 
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier then ever.
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why.

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time all the time

I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same without you, without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I, without you, without you

Oh oh oh
You! You! You! 
Without
You! You! You! 
Without you

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind without you, without you

I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same without you, without you
Without you

Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like three six
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
Like a G 6, like a G 6

It's been a long time since I came around 
Been a long time but I'm back in town 
And this time I'm not leaving without you 

You taste like whiskey when you kiss me oh 
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll 
This time I'm not leaving without you

You say sit back down where you belong 
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on 
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time 
And you said to me there's

(Something), something, something about this place 
(Something), something about lonely nights 
And my lipstick on your face 
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy 
Yeah something about baby you and I 

It's been two years since I let you go 
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll 
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart 

On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold 
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you

Sit back down where you belong 
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on 
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time 
And you said to me there's

(Something), something, something about this place 
(Something), something about lonely nights 
And my lipstick on your face 
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy 
Yeah something about baby you and I 

You and I 
You you and I 
You you and I 
You you and I 

You and I 
You you and I 
Oh yeah, we're gonna die
Without you and I

We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I am a certain my whole life 
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ

(Something), something, something about the chase (six whole years) 
I am a New York woman born to rock you down
So want my lipstick all over your face 
(Something), something, something about just knowing when it's right 
So put your dreams up for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you

You and I 
You you and I 
Baby I'd rather die
Without you and I

You and I 
You you and I
Nebraska
I'd rather die
Without you and I

It's been a long time since I came around 
Been a long time but I'm back in town 
And this time I'm not leaving without you

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

I really hate to let this moment go
Touching your skin and your hair falling slow
When a goodbye kiss, feels like this

Don't you wanna stay here a little while
Don't you wanna hold each other tight
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
Don't you wanna stay here a little while
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay

Let's take it slow I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last

When your up this high, it's a sad goodbye

Don't you wanna stay here a little while
Don't you wanna hold each other tight
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
Don't you wanna stay here a little while
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay

Oh yeah!
Oh you feel so perfect baby
Don't you wanna stay here a little while

Don't you wanna stay here a little while
Don't you wanna hold each other tight
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
Don't you wanna stay here a little while
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay

Don't you wanna stay
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff, 
But these feelin's pilin' up 
Won't give me no rest

This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah, maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me, 
But I'll do my best

If you'll be my soft and sweet, 
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine, 
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day, 
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle, 
I'll be your honey bee

Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I've got you smilin', honey, 
Right back at me

Now, hold on, 'cause I ain't done
There's more where that came from
Well, you know I'm just havin' fun, 
But seriously

If you'll be my Louisiana, 
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta, 
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You be my sugar baby, 
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle, 
I'll be your honey bee

Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothin' left to do, but fall
In each other's arms

I could've said a "I love you"
Could've wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do 
Is speak right from the heart

If you'll be my soft and sweet, 
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine, 
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day, 
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle, 
I'll be your honey bee

You'll be my Louisiana, 
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta, 
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You be my sugar baby, 
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle, 
And I'll be your honey bee

I'll be your honey bee

She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
She needs me now but I can't seem to find a time
I've got a new job now in the unemployment line
And we don't know how we got into this mess it's a gods test
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Sit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
But we both know how we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Sit talking up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
Smiling but we're close to tears

For the first time

Drinking old cheap bottles of wine

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the mane
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Let's go
Yeah
You're listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrap's, brraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Blackman
Where the hells all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the mane
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never took because we needed a change
I needed a break
For a sec' I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say the money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam'
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to turn a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no-one cares about
You just have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the mane
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

Oh seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

You say that I'm messing with your head
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
All cause I was making out with your friend
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

You're on your knees
Begging please
Stay with me
But honestly
I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good,
But now whoa, I'm thinking what the hell
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me
If you hate me
You can't save me
Baby, baby
All my life I've been good
But now
Whoa
What the hell

So what if I go out on a million dates
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You never call or listen to me anyway
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Don't get me wrong
I just need some time to play

You're on your knees
Begging please
Stay with me
But honestly
I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good,
But now
I'm thinking what the hell
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me

You can't save me
Baby, baby

All I want is to mess around

All my life I've been good,

You can't save me

All my life I've been good
But now
Whoa

La la la la la 
La la la la la
La la la la la

Watch me as I dance under the spotlight,
Listen to the people screaming out more, and more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back, 
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back, 
So captivating when I get it on the floor. 

Know y'all been patiently waiting, 
I know you need me, I can feel it, 
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, 
I'm that Monster in the mirror, 
The headliner, finisher, 
I'm the closer, winner. 
Best when under pressure 
with seconds left I show up. 

If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
Get on the floor, bring out the fire, 
And light it up, take it up higher, 
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more. 

Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone tight
Put 'em in the air, if you more (and) more, 
'Cause I can't wait to feel it. 
I go hard, can't stop, 
But if I stop just know that Imma bring it back, 
Never quittin' don't believe in that. 

Know y'all been patiently waiting, 
I know you need me, I can feel it, 
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, 
I'm that monster in the mirror, 
The headliner, finisher, 
I'm the closer, winner. 
Best when under pressure 
with seconds left I show up. 

Ooh ooh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more,
Ooh ooh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Ooh ooh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
Little hazy
But, you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
Yeah, uh-huh, oh

Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Its your anniversary isn't it
And your man ain't acting right
So you packin' your Damier luggage up 
Callin' my cell phone, tryin' catch a flight
You know one thing straight, 
I'll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home that's your man, 
Soon as you land you say that's all me
'Cause shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same
Not sayin' I'm the richest man alive but I'm in the game
As long as you keep it one hundred Imma spend this change

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie
I ain't gon' flex, I'm not gon' front
You know if I ball, then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up

I try to stay out your business
But on the real you're so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up,
Your mans gonna catch onto us
That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
If you rolling I got a spot 
Where I can put you on this medical, 
And send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me 'cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rollin' weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money I'll make more of it
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit

[Chorus]

No matter where I am
No matter where you are
I'll be there when its over baby
'Cause I was there from the start
No matter if I'm near
Don't matter if your far
All you do is pick the phone up lady
And I'll be there when you call

Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie

You know if I ball, then we all gon' stunt

Whenever you call baby I roll up

Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me

I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up

I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?

Can you get to the floor
Can you get to the floor
Can you promise you won't let go

All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm loosing control

'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby
I just don't wanna let go

I hate to see you cry
Your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry
My love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
But baby, baby I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain but I'm smiling for you

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise you won't let go

All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm losing control

'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby
I just don't wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
Don't let go
Don't let go
To my love

I hate to see you cry
Your smile is a beautiful lie

I hate to see you cry
My love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
My love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
But baby, baby I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please, don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I.

Oh lover, don’t you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make momma proud

And when were done, I don’t wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can’t stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you’re almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here

Baby I’ma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go, motivation
Go, go, go, go

Uh, girl I turn that thing into a rain-forest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh, but I go deeper
Make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes
She my motivation, I’m her transportation
Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy
Then I just keep going going, like I’m racing
When I’m done she hold me like a conversation Weezy baby

And when were done, I don’t wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can’t stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you’re almost there
You can do it I believe in you baby
So close from here, baby I'ma be your motivation

Oh lover, when you call my name
No other, can do that the same no
I won’t let ya get up out the game no
So go lover, don't it make me rain

And when were done, I don’t wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can’t stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you’re almost there
You can do it I believe in you baby
So close from here baby I’ma be your motivation

I was thinking bout her, thinkin' bout me
Thinkin' bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah, it was only Just A Dream
So I traveled back, down that road
Will she come back, no one knows
I realize yeah, it was only Just A Dream

I was at the top and now its like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

When I be ridin' man I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hopes she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday its so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say its wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep
When I wrote this,
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breath new life in me
I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me it'll enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon' hug me
But I'm out of options there's nothing else I can do 'cause 

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there just pieces so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like your begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more,
I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

(I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little crack a jack beat making wack ass backwards producers, 
I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause 

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I fly with the stars in the skies,
I am no longer trying to survive,
I believe that life is a prize,
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire it's my empire
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire
In this very moment I'm king
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,
And I will retire with the crown, yes!
No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me!
But I couldn't do it all alone, we!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't phase me
Ain't being cocky we just vindicated, best believe that when were done
This moment will be syndicated, I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything that they deprived me of
Put ya drinks up,
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive (yeah, yeah, yeah uh)

I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!

'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives, ah!

Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit

Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one

I walk around the club, 
fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, 
nigga what money?
I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
It's a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one yeah, 
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one

(Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up)

Lately I been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think,
Time to flow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinkin' it
When the lights out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show
All the dirt
I am running through my mind

Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told who I should do it with
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the lights out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

Shame on me (shame on me)
To need release (to need release)
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably)

Yeah I'm chilling on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires

Back in the day pop's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Man mind your business watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking man ya'll ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missin'

Yeah I'm chilling on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires

I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
If it's broke round here we fix it
I can take ya'll where you need to go
Down to my hood and back in them woods
We do it different 'round here that's right
And we sure do it good and we do it all night
So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with a truck and four wheel
Jump on in tell yo' friends
And we'll be raising hell where the black top ends

I'm chilling on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires that's right

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires that's right

Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings
When it feels so hard to breathe
Caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back 
When I'm holding you in my arms
We don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
And I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer 
To the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real 
No it's never felt so right

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
And I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

No I don't want to say goodnight
I know it's time to leave, 
But you'll be in my dreams

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, oh, let's do this right 

With just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight
Kiss goodnight

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Ahem excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, we're a fuckin' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doing this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish

I'm going back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these mu'fuckers talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, guess I'm Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, gonna need a little luck
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a B.X. nigga, ya heard?
Gunna

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

I'm back where I belong, 
Yeah I never felt so strong
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high
(put your hands high)

If you ever lost a light before, 
This ones for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear "The Tears of a Clown"
I hate that song
I always feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
Its easy to be Puff, but its harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitable prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taneisha I'll be back in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

"A House is Not A Home", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up your phone, come on

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

"Ain't No Stopping Us Now", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
Is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)
And here I stand, a better man! (a better man)
Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord)
Thank you all!

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

Dirty bit
Dirty bit

So come on, let's go, let's lose control
Let's do it all night 'til we can't do it no more

People rockin' to the sound, turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top until the roof come burnin' down
Yeah, it's hot in here, the temperature
Has got these ladies gettin' freakier

I got freaky, freaky baby, I was chillin' with my ladies
I didn't come to get bougie, I came here to get crazy
I was born to get wild, that's my style
If you didn't know that, well, maybe, now you know now

'Cause I'm havin' a good time with you
I'm tellin' you

I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

Oh, I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

Dirty bit
Dirty bit

All these girls they like my swagger, they callin' me Mick Jagger
I be rollin' like a stone, jet setter, jet lagger
We ain't messin' with no maggots, messin' with the baddest
Chicks in the club, honey, what's up?

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the baddest of them all?
Yeah, it's gotta be the apple, I'm the Mac daddy y'all
Haters better step back, ladies, download your app
I'm the party application, rock it just like that

'Cause I'm havin' a good time with you
I'm tellin' you

I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

Oh, I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

Oh, I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

Dirty bit

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep it stuck your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

If I was an old-school, fifty pound boom box
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song 
Uh oh uh oh 

Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when 
She stands under my colours, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no 
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin.
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song 

The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man 
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar 
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin' 
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song 
Uh oh (uh oh)

The ballad of a dove 
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em oh

The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls

This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em' skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass buzzards, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with five nine
But I feel like I'm six eight

By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron 
To going and buying four or five of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr.Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right 
Till he can march right 
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in twenty years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal 
And now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight, but tonight we're alright
So hold up your light, let it shine 'cause 

Dance

Back door, cracked we don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool Aid follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

It's time to kill the lights and
Shut the D.J. down
This place's about to
Tonight we're taken over
No one's getting out!

Dirt and glitter cover the floor

We're young and we're bored
It's time to lose your mind
And let the crazy out
This place's about to
Tonight we're taking names
'Cause we don't mess around
This place's about to blow-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh

Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the t.v. on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no

I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
Oh

Ooh hoo ooh hoo

Tomorrow I'll wake up do some p90x
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out this is great

But sorry pops you'll just have to wait
Oh

Yes I said it

I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone

'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
No no no no no no no no no oh

And let everything hang loose
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh, today I don't feel like doing anything

Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
From Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me
What there is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A good good life 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hopelessly
I feel like like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly
I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly
I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly
The hope is we have so much to feel good about

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life, oh yeah
A good, good life

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, a good good life, good life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoah, woah, listen,

To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
From Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me
What there is to complain about

I heard, that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're, married now

I heard, that you're dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I had hoped you'd see my face 
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I hoped you'd see my face 
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes their memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet
This would taste

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Turn the music up
A lil' louder, yeah

You had a lot of crooks try'na steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love (how to love)
How to love (how to love)
Mm you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner try'na put it together
How to love (how to love)
How to love (how to love)

Mm for a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love (had a love)

When you was just a youngin', your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you, can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love (had a love)
How to love (how to love)

Ooh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love (how to love) 
How to love (how to love)
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner try'na put it together
How to love (how to love) 
How to love (how to love)

Ooh, see I just want you to know (You to know)
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You're far from the usual, far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

Now you in this corner try'na put it together
How to love (how to love)

Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss 'No way, it's all good', it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing, underestimated
Look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean when you talk about yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices in your head make them like you instead
So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same

Woah oh, pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line, and we try try try
But we try too hard and it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, cause they're everywhere
They don{t like my jeans; they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves, and we do it all the time
Why do we do that? Why do I do that

Why do I do that?
Yeah, oh, oh baby, pretty baby
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me, yeah
You're perfect, you're perfect
Oh pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothin' you're fuckin' perfect to me

She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

Listen to me when I say"

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
I say

When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing 
Just the way you are 
And when you smile 
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing 
Just the way you are 
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing 
Just the way you are 
And when you smile

Just the way you are

Yeah

There's a stranger in my bed,
There's a pounding my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue

This a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled, damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
We're screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots

Skinny dipping in the dark

Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Oh whoa

Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room
He won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette hanging out his mouth 
He's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden in a box of fun things
And I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
Because dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say your hair's on fire
You must have lost your wits, yeah

Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is for pleasure
'Cause nothing can measure

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, 
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,

Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more, 

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na come on, come on, come on,

S, S, S and M, M, M

Oh I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah,
I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing

They say be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lovers
Different DNA, they don't understand you

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

There is this transcendental, on another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I risk it all, all

Kiss me, k-k-kiss me 
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again

Do you ever feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come and show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come and let your colors burst
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em falling down down down

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come and show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come and let your colors burst
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe-awe-awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
And it's always been inside of you you you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come and show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come and let your colors burst
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe

Party rock is in the house tonight

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
It all, it all, it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it
To the beat
