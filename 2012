Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing 
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing 
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody, I used to know
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody, I used to know
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know, that I used to know, I used to know somebody

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blownin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
It's hard to look right 
At you, baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
And all the other boys 
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg and follow and steal
Have foresight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blownin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
It's hard to look right 
At you, baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you 
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
And all the other boys 
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that 
I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right 
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you 
And this crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
And all the other boys 
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me, maybe

Give me a second I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she’s waiting for me just across the bar
My seat’s been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you’re trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I’m trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I’ll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that I’m not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let’s raise a toast
‘Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

The moon is on my side (Nananananana)
I have no reason to run (Nananananana)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
The angels never arrived (Nananananana)
But I can hear the choir (Nananananana)
So will someone come and carry me home (Nananananana)

Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I’ll carry you home tonight

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember,
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture,
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it,
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed,
Still stuck in that time,
When we called it love,
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song , I'll be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow,
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine,
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before,
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed,
Still stuck in that time,
When we called it love,
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting,
And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it,
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it,
Don't need my name on my show,
You can tell it I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
that little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope they'll still be there
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In another place
The only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

(Lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights)

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
Dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home, home
(lights, lights, lights)

Home, home
(lights, lights, lights)

The sun goes down
The stars come out
And all that counts
Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no-one else can see, you and me

Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time,
Time is slipping away away from us so stay,
Stay with me I can make,
Make you glad you came

The sun goes down
The stars come out
And all that counts
Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no-one else can see, you and me

Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time,
Time is slipping away away from us so stay,
Stay with me I can make,
Make you glad you came

The sun goes down
The stars come out
And all that counts
Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came

I'm glad you came
So glad you came
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came

The sun goes down
The stars come out
And all that counts
Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on, over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me, but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

(When I'm alone)

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Let's go to the beach, each

You're insecure,
Don't know what for,
You're turning heads when you walk through the door,
Don't need make-up, to cover up,
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it,
Everyone else but you

Baby you light up my world like nobody else,
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,
You don't know, oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful,
If only you saw what I can see,
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,
You don't know, oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,
That's what makes you beautiful

So come on, you got it wrong,
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song,
I don't know why, you're being shy,
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it,
Everyone else but you

Baby you light up my world like nobody else,
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,
You don't know, oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful,
If only you saw what I can see,
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,
You don't know, oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,
That's what makes you beautiful

(Na na na na na na na)

Baby you light up my world like nobody else,
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,
You don't know, oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby you light up my world like nobody else,
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,

You don't know, oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,
That's what makes you beautiful

Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do

I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh

I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jump and don't stop
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models

Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do

I wanna shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh

Party rocker, fa-show stopper, more shampoo
Number one, club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder when we hit fame
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do

I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh

I am a wild one, break me in 
Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl

Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough
I hear you like the wild stuff

Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones) ooh

I am a wild one break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where it felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where it felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh, oh

Oh no
Let it burn
Oh oh oh
Let it burn
Let it burn

When I walk on by, girls be looking like damn he fly
I pimp to the beat, 
Walking on the street with in my new lafreak, yeah

Girl look at that body

Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants 
And I ain't afraid to show it (show it, show it, show it)

I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight 'em off
When I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get serviced

Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know anymore
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh

This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,
But here they come again to jack my style

That's alright (that's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm Mmm

Well, some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change.
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win, I always win

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know (oh, come on)

So this is it. I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

(Come on)

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on.
Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on!

Well, that is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home;
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call "love"
When I look into my nephew's eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from
Some terrible nights ah 

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh

The other night you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up but we'd both agree

It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance 
Oh
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance 
Oh

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
I'm wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong

I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
Picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
I am trying to hold on
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no

Yes I can, doubt that I leave, I'm running with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip
Like you the one drinking what God sip dot com
Now I gotta work with your tongue
How many rolling stones you want
Yeah I got a brand new spirit,
Speak it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, US to Taiwan
I hope you say that, I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a wrap, ASAP

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second, I'ma strike oil
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Gotta drill a land, never giving in
Giving ups not an option, gotta get it in
Witness I got the heart of twenty men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever can't hold me down
A hundred miles feelin' from the picture smile
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates,
Take a genius to understand me

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Good feelin', good feelin'

Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'
Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no

You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we start keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can't do this no more

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid coming back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
And I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go 
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe
Or where ever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me
Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the "how you been"
And get down to the "more than friends" at last

Oh but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to

And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true, 'cause

Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

I'm the fuckin' man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya

Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura

Clubbing hard, fuckin' women ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uhh

Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you babe
Looking for you babe
Searching for you babe

Hey baby won't you look my way
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby what you gotta say?
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
I found out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mamas always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

Hey honey you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itchin'
Oh my my
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, too much

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mamas always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

Never thought I'd live
To see the day
When everybody's words got in the way

Hey sugar show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar what you gotta say?

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mamas always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks back

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her

Everybody talks, everybody talks back

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thanking you, just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry,
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium, I am titanium, I am titanium, I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who has further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm bulletproof nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium, I am titanium, I am titanium

Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard, thus bulletproof glass

You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
I am titanium

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up, still looking up.

Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

If you ever leave me, baby,
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.

There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor (Ooh)
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door.

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yeah for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

Oh, don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye),
Don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I can take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby take a chance or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I don't know 'bout me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three two

I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go

I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe
At the end of it all you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release
Which way is right?
Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can lie no more
I can hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much you deserve
Nothing to say
Nothing to do
I've nothing to give
I must live without you
You know we're heading separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can lie no more
I can hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way

Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now, now look at me

This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no!
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no!
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no!

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now, now look at me

This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no!
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no!
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no!

Now look at me I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again I’m glowin’ oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything yeah, yeah except for me

This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no!

Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul

Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul

That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean dont it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501′s jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you b-tch smokin' grade A

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, its gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, this is it, I've had enough
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (what?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oh we called it off again last night
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oh, you called me up again tonight
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We! Are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, never say never
Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together like, ever

(No!) We are never ever, ever getting back together
We! Are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we! Are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, are not getting back together,
We oh, not getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

As long as you love me (love me, love me)
As long as you love me (love me, love me)
As long as you love me 

We're under pressure,
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl,
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me

I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl
I'll be your Hova, you can be my Destiny's Child on a scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, 

I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,
I'll beat ya there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust
A couple of things I can't spell without you
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like whoa (oh God)
Camera's point and shoot,
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you 
You the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, 
As long as you love, love me 

As long as you love me
I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
Love me,

Please don't go (love me, love me)

You wanted control so we waited

You say I'm a kid my ego is big
I don't give a shit and it goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger

Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Baby it's hard when you feel like 
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right, but when you're with me
I make you believe that I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car we can ride it
Wherever you want get inside it
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear
I'll take it from here oh yeah yeah and it goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger

Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight

Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you

Tie a knot in the rope
Trying to hold, trying to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You've had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss all of the fighting
That we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say "there is nothing left"

No more sick whiskey dick
No more battles from me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep

I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You've had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all

You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the whys
Will all be crystal clear

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You've had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You've had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere

Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like rest?

And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break

We can take it if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart

Your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break

When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run
Don't wanna break your heart
I wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break

How you know, I got that feeling 
You are now watching the throne 
Don't let me into my zone
I'm definitely in my zone

Summer after high school, when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

The one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should'a told you what you meant to me, whoa
Cause now I pay the price

The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)

In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field.
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal.
Your love pours down on me surround me like a waterfall.
And there's no stopping us right now, I feel so close to you right now.

I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field.
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal.
Your love pours down on me surround me like a waterfall.
And there's no stopping us right now, I feel so close to you right now.

And there's no stopping us right now.
And there's no stopping us right now.
And there's no stopping us right now.
I feel so close to you right now.

I heard, that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're, married now

I heard, that you're dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I had hoped you'd see my face 
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I hoped you'd see my face 
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes their memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet
This would taste

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

My fantasy hotter than Miami I feel the heat 
Oh oh oh oh it's international love 
Oh oh oh oh it's international love 

I don't play football 
But I've touched down everywhere (everywhere?) everywhere
I don't play baseball 
But I've hit a home run everywhere everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce 
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed 
In Romania she pulled me to the side 
And told me Pit you can have me and my sister 
In Lebanon yeah the women the bomb 
And in Greece you guessed it the women are sweet 
Been all around the world 
But I ain't gonna lie there's nothing like Miami's heat 

You put it down like New York City 
I never sleep wild like Los Angeles 
My fantasy hotter than Miami I feel the heat 
Oh oh oh oh it's international love

Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh, international love 
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh, international love

Hold on, to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave is stringing us along
Just know you’re not alone
'Cause I’m going to make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

Just know you’re not alone
'Cause I’m going to make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

Just know you’re not alone
'Cause I’m going to make this place your home

I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same without you, without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I, without you, without you

Oh oh oh
You! You! You! 
Without
You! You! You! 
Without you

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind without you, without you

I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same without you, without you
Without you

Oh, it's so sexy, yo

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm in at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it
Let em talk, let em talk, let em talk, let em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let em walk, let em walk, let em walk, let em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We'll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let's go

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home.

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me 
Makes sense when I'm with you

Like everything that's green girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it 
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up 
Wanna kiss your lips 
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine 
Wanna hold your hand forever 
Never let you forget it 
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted

Anyone can tell you you're pretty
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the make up
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips 
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine 
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it 
'Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted 

As good as you make me feel I 
I wanna make you feel better 
Better than your fairy tales 
Better than your best dreams 
You're more than everything I need 
You're all I ever wanted 
All I ever wanted 

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips 
I wanna make you feel wanted 
And I wanna call you mine 
Wanna hold your hand forever 
And never let you forget it 
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted 
Baby I wanna make you feel wanted

You'll always be wanted

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drive
And a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon

Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Tippin' n' spillin' that home made wine
On your tied up T-shirt

Thrown little cherry bombs into my fire

And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom 
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans

The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there all night long
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, oh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark

Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born in the USA'
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Whoa Springsteen

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

This is more than a typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, oh oh
Didn't want to take it slow
In a daze, going crazed, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow

Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour

Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word, sipping on that Patron
Just to calm my nerves, oh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone
Oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, hold me up
Maybe I'm in doubt, oh oh
Now don't even think you know, no no

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you say, it's like a gold with a view
Business on the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it so come and get it, cheerio

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Oh oh oh oh
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheeri, cheeri, cheerio

When you gonna call
Don't leave me broken hearted
I've been waiting up
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right, cheerio, uh!

Dreams
That's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope
Hope there's a conversation
Where we both admit we had it good
But until then
It's alienation I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

Damn
Damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
And still your magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around
And I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

And if I had the chance
To renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you
Not over you
Not over you
Not over you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep it stuck your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

If I was an old-school, fifty pound boom box
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo

Let's excuse me baby
Go, yeah you baby
Back, ooh you groovy baby
In, let's make a movie baby
Time, excuse me baby
Let's, yeah you baby
Go, ooh you groovy baby
Back in, let's make a movie baby, time

It's Mr Worldwide, Agent A, Reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride

Back, back, in, in, time

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

Miami equals black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
OK, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture, bury a boarder, record-breaker won't cha
Give credit where credit is due don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future we have to go back in time

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I’d bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future, we have to go back in time

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

Let's excuse me baby
Go, yeah you baby
Back, ooh you groovy baby
In, let's make a movie baby
Time, excuse me baby
Let's, yeah you baby
Go, ooh you groovy baby
Back in, let's make a movie baby, time

(Baby, oh baby oh baby, my sweet baby you're the one)

I wanna see you work for me, work out for me

Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if I'mma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You're probably hopin' never would end
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand well then

Let me see you get high and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

High and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

She like them bar with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old Range
I knew her when I rocked big old chains
Now the little nigga doing big old things
Would you look at that, I came back for her
Just to give it to you, like you asked for it
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard
I told her, baby girl come here
Know I run the town even when I aint from there
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party I made
What your nigga make in one year, thats unfair but
So is life, take a chance roll a dice
Money can't buy you love cause it's over priced
Don't over think just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night

Let me see you get high and go low
Now girl would you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me
High and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

Carolina blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block, damn girl you mean
They be starting shit, but it's your world
On my Martin shit, you go girl
She bad and you know it, some niggas save Hoes

Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World

(Cole World)

Straight up, now tell me do you really wanna love me forever
Oh, oh, oh

(Work out for me, work out for me)

She, she ain't real,
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,
She is a stranger,
You and I have history,
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all,
But, baby, is that really what you want

Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of you,
And, boy, she's bringing you down,
She made your heart melt,
But you're cold to the core,
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh

She is half your age,
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed,
I heard you've been missing me,
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,
Haven't you heard the rumors

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of me,
And, boy, you're bringing me down,
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,

Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh

All of these words whispered in my ear,
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,
People say crazy things,
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,

Hey, good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you’re thinkin' about
You'll see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you cryin'
With your heart in the dirt

His lips are dripping honey
But he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving
Go and throw away the key

Hey good girl
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
It’s just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me
He’s low, low, low

Hey, good girl
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love

But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey good girl
So good for him
Better back away honey
You don’t know where he’s been

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
It’s just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Yeah yeah yeah, he’s low
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
It’s just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good

Won’t you open up your eyes?
It’s just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes

Back this hitch up into the water 
Untie all the cables and rope 
Step onto the AstroTurf 
Get yourself a coozie 
Let's go 

Who said anything about skiin'? 
Floatin' is all I wanna do 
You can climb the ladder 
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque 

On the pontoon 
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof 
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to 
Party in slow motion 
Out here in the open 
Mm, motorboatin' 

(Hoo hoo hoo) 

Reach your hand down into the cooler 
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue 
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube 

Pontoon 
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof 
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to 
Party in slow motion 
Out here in the open 
Mm, motorboatin' 

(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)

Five mile an hour with aluminum side 
Wood panelin' with a water slide 
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride 

On the pontoon 
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof 
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to 
Party in slow motion 
I'm out here in the open 
Mm, motorboatin' 

On the pontoon 
(Hoo hoo hoo) 
On the pontoon 
(Hoo hoo hoo) 

Back this hitch out into the water 
On the pontoon 

(Hoo hoo hoo) 
(Hoo hoo hoo)

(Ho hey, ho hey)

(Ho) I been trying to do it right 
(Hey) I been living a lonely life
(Ho) I been sleepin' here instead
(Hey) I been sleepin' in my bed
(Ho) I been sleepin' in my bed (Hey ho)

(Ho) So show me family 
(Hey) All the blood that I will bleed 
(Ho) I don't know where I belong
(Hey) I don't know where I went wrong
(Ho) But I can write a song (Hey)

I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet' (Ho)

(Hey, ho hey)

(Ho) I don't think you're right for him 
(Hey) Think of what it might have been if we 
(Ho) Took a bus to Chinatown 
(Hey) I'd be standin' on canal (Ho) and Bowery (Hey)
(Ho) She'd be standin' next to me (Hey)

I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart

Love we, need it now
Let's hope, for some
'Cause oh, we're bleedin' out

I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet' (Ho hey, ho hey)

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach 
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy 
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Daddy was mean a old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister
She prayed blow it down
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window till it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away, (Blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away (blown away)
Till there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) 
It all, it all, it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it
To the beat

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to
Run away
Do we separate? Oh
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now?
When I need you around
I'm on my knees, but it seems we're

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all
At all

You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

Work hard, play hard 
Work 
Diamonds all on my ring nigga
Gold watches, gold chain nigga
Hundred thou' on champagne nigga
Yeah my money insane nigga
Yeah I'm making it rain nigga
But I was just on the plane nigga
Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, it’s my time of year
If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rolling up so I get love for that
Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
My nigga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that
You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink
But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!

The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..

Hop your pretty ass up in this fucking car
Bitch I'm out this world, girl you know I'm a star
Used to buying rounds but now we buy the bar
Last year they had to ask now they know who we are
Boss shit, walk in the building, I own shit
You can tell by who I'm on the phone with
Yeah nigga talking about grown shit
Niggas too busy jacking my swag
Need to fuck around, get your own shit
Get your own cars, get your own clothes
Get your own smoke, get your own bitch
You ain't reppin' my gang, get your own clique

Go hard
Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do, that's your job
And niggas gon' hate but that's no prob'
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing
It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG
And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don't see

Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had
Ooh baby if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life

Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby, oh
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you, oh

It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile
I would like to show you what true love can really do

Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you

Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down
Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own 'em
Some call me Nicki, and some call me Roman
Skeeza, pleeza, I'm in Ibiza
Giuseppe Zanotti, my own sneaker
Sexy, sexy that's all I do
If you need a bad bitch
Let me call a few
Pumps on and them little mini skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'mma turn 'em out
OK bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no mussel, hey?
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no mussel, let's go

Music, makes me, high

Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

I wanna do it for the night, night
So get me now, and knock this over
I wanna do it like you like, like
Come get me, baby we're not getting younger
I just want you tonight, night
Baby we won't do it for life

Music, makes me, high

Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Pound the alarm!

Alarm, alarm, alarm, alarm

Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

I turned the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

Turn the lights on! Oh wo-oh, oh wo-oh

We share something so common
Still so rare, and I'm in awe
Never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls
Breaking each others hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so

In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this f***in' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (Oh wo-oh) 
Would hurt this f***in' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
Cause I'm slowly breaking down
Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this f***in' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (Oh wo-oh) 
Would hurt this f***in' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts,
Cause I wanna leave, and you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together

And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this f***in' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (Oh wo-oh) 
Would hurt this f***in' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

I done came down, hold up, grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
'cause I ain't trying to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-town so I made to lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm easy tag like peter pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cooking dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out,
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm g'd up, east up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't trying to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm coming baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup
Oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup (this drank)
I got this drank in my cup (this drank)
Cup, cup..

I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style
Same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book
Different song, same hook
Every time her nigga tripping
She on the phone with the same crook
And every time I pull up
She hit me with that same look
Lips biting, hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
But only if you got that sip tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip tight
Only if you got that mind bomb
Only if you got that zip tight
Eat that shit like won ton
Joking baby, I'm pimp type
I'm used to being that one and done
But girl you got that (g-get right)

H-town
Oh yeah
I got this drink in my cup
I got this drink in my cup
(cup, cup, cup)
I came down, hold up
Hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up... fuck, shit

Come and put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Your name
Bet you wanna put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Ba-ba-baby

Can't wait to blow my candles out

He want that cake, cake,
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake

And it's not even my birthday
But you wanna put your name on it
And it's not even my birthday
And he tryna put his name on it
Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now
Just get up on my body
I'll do anything

Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite, cause she admires the art
Of Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect
So smile, and pack your bags real good, baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while while while while

Girl tell me how you feel, what your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my senorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La la la la la la, you never had it so good
La la la la la la

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour lay overs from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy, and maybe see the coliseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa
Now smile, and pack your bags real good, baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while

Girl tell me how you feel, what your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my senorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La la la la la la, you never had it so good
La la la la la la, you never had it so good

Well I been feeling singular, how about let's make it plural
Spin the globe, whatever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the wall's with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A rose, a burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we’re Barcelona bound
Smile, and pack your bags real good, baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while

Girl tell me how you feel, what your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my senorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La la la la la la, you never had it so good
La la la la la la, you never had it so good
La la la la la la, you never had it so good
La la la la la la, you never had it so good

My heart is paralyzed
My head was over sized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntan
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water 
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drown in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to 
Love, but you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntan
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drown in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east-side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say goodbye

Now a red solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues tailgates fairs and festivals
And you sir do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass

A red solos cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years they are decomposable
And unlike my home they are not fore-closable
Freddie Mac can kiss my ass woo

Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party

Now I really love how your easy to stack
But I really hate how your easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down the front of my back
Well that my friends is quite yucky

But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring how sharply my first name is written
On you with a sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky

Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party

Now I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you red will do for this fellow
'Cause you are my Abbot to my Costello
And you are the fruit to my loom

Red solo cup you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

Red solo cup, you're not just a cup. (No, no, God no)
You're my, you're my friend. (Friend, friend, friend, life long)
Thank you for being my friend.

Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party

Red solo cup, red solo cup (I fill you up, let's have a party)
Let's have a party (Let's have a party) Let's have a party
(Red solo cup) Oh red solo cup (I lift you up)
Let's have a party, proceed to party yeah yeah

It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of 'em
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold, a miracle, lyrical
You've saved my life again
And I want you to know baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat

Constantly, boy you played through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me, what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free, I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are, and I want you to know baby

No one compares
You stand alone, to every record I own
Music to my heart that's what you are

Conversation got boring
You said you're goin' to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (uh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (uh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (uh) and I was hoping

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?

And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (oh)
And then ask me kindly (oh)
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night and then we always wake up singing the same song

It's 5 o'clock in the morning (yeah)
Conversation got boring (talk to me girl)
You said you're goin' to bed soon (let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (c'mon)

And I pretended I was sleeping (alright)
And I was hoping you would creep in 

(Goodnight) It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're goin' to bed soon

I can hear your voice in my head like "What is he doing?" oh what is he doing?
Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
You texting me like I'm a kill y'all

So I snuck up to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
You ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at six, left around four thirty yeah so by the time I'm at your crib
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
And you yawning, but I've been drinking all night and I feel like performin'
With you in the bedroom floor to the dresser
Don't want nothing less 'cause I'm sure you're the best you're the one so I let you
That's how you show me love
And when we finish you like "damn, babe you woke me up"
I love you way you put it down likes it's for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're goin' to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in
It's 5 o'clock in the morning

Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died everyday, waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything, take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died everyday, waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed, I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer
One step closer

I have died everyday, waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed, I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Been goin' round and round all day
Bailin' some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a little Shiner Bock
[Another version says "Grab a couple Rocky Tops" in reference to Coors beer.]
Then ease on out your way
To your place around 8 o'clock

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little backroad
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that's a good night
Anyone from the heartland is gonna understand
What I'm talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little backroad
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little backroad
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer you can play my radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you
Take a little ride with you
I wanna take a little ride with you

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

Baby, I love you, I need you here
Give me all the time
Baby we meant to be
You got me, smiling all the time

'Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go runnin', runnin'
Tryin' to get away from loving ya

Yep, I'm falling for ya 
But there's nothin' wrong with that

My love is your love, your love is mine

Baby come, tear me now, hold me now
Make me come alive
You got the sweetest touch
I'm so happy, you came in my life

'Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go runnin', runnin'
Tryin' to get away from loving ya
You know how to love me hard

And yes I'm kinda crazy 
That's what happens baby 
When you put it down
You shouldnt've give it to me good like that
Shouldnt've hit it like that, had me yellin' like that
Didn't know you would've had me coming back

You the one that I'm feeling
You the one that I'm loving
Ain't no other, niggas like you
No there's just one, one, one
No baby just one, one, one 
I bet you wanna know

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine

When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where to start, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, apart
And when the world screams "sound, sound, sound"
Where the sound is the key of my heart, heart

We run as we run the night, the night
We run as we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-night
We run as we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
We run as we run the night, the night, ni-ni-ni-ni

Run the night, run 'em, run 'em
Run the night, run 'em, run 'em

Feelin' like a rush, rush, rush
Pushing past me all over my skin, ski-i-i-in
I can get enough, 'nough, 'nough
'Cause the beat keep pullin me in, in
Takin' me so high, up, up, up
A place that I've never been, ahh
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day then do it again, 'gain

We run as we run the night, the night
We run as we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-night
We run as we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
We run as we run the night, the night, ni-ni-ni-ni

Run the night, run 'em, run 'em
Run the night, run 'em, run 'em

We run as we run the night, the night (we run, we run)
We run as we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-night (we run the night, the night)
We run as we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
We run as we run the night, the night, ni-ni-ni-ni

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

Girl, I know I don't know you.
But your pretty little eyes so blue,
Are pulling me in like the moon on your skin.
I'm so glad you trusted me to slide up on this dusty seat 
And let your hair down, and get outta town.

Got the stars comin' out,
Over my hood.
And all I know now.
Is it's going good.

You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck.
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song.
I'm set on cruise control.
I'm slowly losing hold of everything I got.
You're looking so damn hot.
And I don't know what road we're on,
Or where we've been from starin' at you.
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end.

Gonna cuss the morning,
When it comes.
'Cause I know that the rising sun,
Ain't no good for me.
'Cause you'll have to leave.
Gonna make the most of every mile.
Do anything to make your smile,
Land on my lips.
And get drunk on your kiss.
The clock on the dash,
Says 3:35.
There's plenty of gas,
And the night's still alive.

You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck.
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song.
I'm set on cruise control.
I'm slowing losing hold of everything I got.
You're looking so damn hot.
And I don't know what road we're on,
Or where we've been from starin' at you.
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end.

I am insensitive, I have a tendency 
To pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust, 
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
Oh I don't make it easy, 
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
You say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball 
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus 
And I wish that I could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
Oh I don't make it easy, 
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,
I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
You say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances 
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted, 
I'm just a man, 
I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love, 
Oh I don't make it easy,
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love 
And you say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me

Hard to love, hard to love, 
Oh I don't make it easy,
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love 
And you say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

You love me good
You love me good

A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal

After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate, on a summer night

With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmers field, will make a boy a mess
There's somethin bout a girl in a red sundress

On that dropped tailgate back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips beggin for another kiss

A couple guys in first class on a flight
From new York to Los Angeles,
Kinda making small talk killing time,
Flirting with the flight attendants,
Thirty thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma,
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms,
Man it all looks the same,
Miles and miles of back roads and highways,
Connecting little towns with funny names,
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere,

They've never drove through Indiana,
Met the men who plowed that earth,
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me,
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas,
They'd understand why God made those fly over states,

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
Where they windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky

You'd think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those fly over states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
Why you'd want to plant your stakes
In those fly over states

Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma, 
Take a ride

Way back on the radio dial,
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul,
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk,
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin,
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Some dreams stay with you forever,
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better,
Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart"

Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, keep on dreamin', oh oh oh

oh oh oh, don't let it break your heart

The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames, climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
