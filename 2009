We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

And I said,
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go

And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone 
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess 
It's a love story baby just say yes 

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby just say "Yes"

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes"

Oh, oh, 
Oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out that house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go!
People to see, time is precious
I looked at my cotty, are ya out of control?

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies, it's on
Then pop in the next 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade-away shot
'Cause we ballin' it's Platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goodie powers

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Hey, shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like her number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Franklins

A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand

She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me
Like, "Damn it, I know you"
You wanna shoot like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Yeah, I'm spendin' my money, I'm out of control
Somebody help me she takin' my bank roll
But I'm king of the club and I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my best-est
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn, 
to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing 
We are just one big family
And It's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't 
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours

All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies

Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me

I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter in my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can care less what you think

I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn and now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh

Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve

Here's a man that makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I'm the one you own
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost Ill be gone

All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up, oh, oh, oh

'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh

In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up three A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just goin' keep hatin' me
And we just goin' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm goin' take off tonight
Into the night

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence love
And where's that shiny car
And did it ever get you far
You never seemed so tense love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are

And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can't look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song and you sing along but you never tell
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well
Hope it gives you hell

When you hear this song
I hope that it will treat you well

You can sing along
I hope that it puts you through hell

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone

Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong you reply
Then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get jumped
That next, they don't wanna stop
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive,
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you
Could fuck around, get shot die any day
Niggas die, every day all over
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music
Or did the ones, with the good sense
Not use it, usually niggas
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall
So they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess,
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take time to think,
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away.

I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn, what a life I had
Most of that shit, look back just laugh
Some shit, still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy, till be around
Had I not, hit the nigga
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night
Cause I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes
Just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away.

I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north,
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone,
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north,
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone,
But the new me will be alright

I found God on the corner of First in Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said "where you been?"
He said, "ask anything"

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Early morning
City breaks
I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all our love

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?

Why'd you have to wait
To find me?
To find me?

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody

Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody

I've been roaming around,
Always looking down at all I see

Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate, that they're serving on a platter
So what we goin' have, dessert or disaster

I never thought I'd, be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in, and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm in a race
But I already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
(as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking bout our life our house and kids (yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

I never thought I'd
Hear myself say (ooh)
Y'all go ahead
I think I'm gonna kick it wit my girl today (kick it wit my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
Of my pimp ship flying high (flying high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky)

Hey, now I'm crashing, don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never too much
She helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight,
Girl sometimes love

Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams that
Seem to only date the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughing
We, were never meant to be baby we just happen
So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us

Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average

For advice
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Whoa it's me
Baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic

I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him

Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So will u bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa
I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
Whoa, whoa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)

Won't see it coming when it happens (hey)
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down
Yeah

Blame it on the booze
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol

Hey she say she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she easy
I hear you saying what ya wont do
But you know we probably goin' do
What you been feigning deep inside
Don't lie now

Girl what you drinking?Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol

Oopsy
She spilled some drank on me
And now I'm knowing she's tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keep staring me right in my eyes
No telling what I'm going do
Baby I'd rather show you
What you been missing in your life when I get inside.

Girl what you drinking?
Goin' let sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking

See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and if you're down I'll pouring

Before my buzz set in, 
My buzz set in

I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty, didn't you know
It's going down, we can go kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride, all over my ride
She look me dead in the eye
Then my pants got bigga
She already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, I, I

Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol

Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With they Henny in they cups screamin'
Money ain't a thing, if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky
Hold your drinks up high (high)

And to my independent mommas
Who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla, tell 'em, bye
Hold your drinks up high

Ey, this is special what's happenin' to all my
All my all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here,
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

(So live your life)

On a battlefield of love

You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down, down, down
Baby are you down down down down down, down, down
Even if the sky is falling down

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming but
There's a voice inside my head saying,
You'll never reach it,
Every step I'm taking,
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shaking but I
Got to keep trying
Got to keep my head held high

There's always going to be another mountain
I'm always going to want to make it move
Always going to be an uphill battle,
Sometimes I'm gonna to have to lose,
Ain't about how fast I get there,
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing,
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down but
No I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm going to remember most yeah
Just got to keep going
And I,
I got to be strong
Just keep pushing on, cause

There's always going to be another mountain
I'm always going to want to make it move
Always going to be an uphill battle,
Sometimes I'm gonna to have to lose,
Ain't about how fast I get there,

And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle 
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it

Just make sure they that special somebody
Young money, yeah yeah
You know who you are, I got you

Guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

Maybe I was stupid
For telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong
For tryin' to pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out I'm nothing without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go
Oh yeah

'Cause we belong together now, yeah yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

'Cause we belong (yeah) together now (together now), (yeah)
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Chorus]
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Halo, halo

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know

And you over think
Always speak
Cryptically

I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now you're plain boring

I should know that
You're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bi-polar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down.

My eyes are open wide
By the way
I made it through the day
I watch the world outside
By the way
I'm leaving out today

I just saw Haley's comet, shooting
She waved, said, "Why are you always running in place"
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother, tell my father
I have done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close it's only for today

I just saw Haley's comet, she waved
She waved, said, "Why are you always running in place"
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Here is my chance
This is my chance

Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first
I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope ya feel the same

All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody goin' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

There's only two types of guys out there,
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared
So baby I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship so, beware
I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that ya feel the same

Let's go
Let me see what you can do
I'm runnin' this (like, like, like, like a circus)
Yeah
Like a what? (like, like, like, like a circus)

Day and night (what, what)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (what, what)
I look for peace but see I don't attain (what, what)
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Now look at this (what, what)
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me (what, what)
I try to run but see I'm not that fast (what, what)
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
Hes all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

Hold the phone (what, what)
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo (what, what)
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade (what, what)
Within his dreams he see's the life he made, made
The pain is deep (what, what)
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep (what, what)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him to (what, what)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

Slow mo, (what, what)
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new (what, what)
He seems alive though he is feeling blue (what, what)
The sun is shining man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights (what, what)
They fade away he slips into his white Nikes (what, what)
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way (what, what)
To free his mind in search of,
To free his mind in search of,
To free his mind in search of

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
Hes all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

At, at, at night

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess,
Whoa, am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in the cab,
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And the Jay Z song was on
And the Jay Z song was on
And the Jay Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song,
And the butterflies fly away
Noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up,
They're playin' my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA

Get to the club in a taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like "who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?
She's gotta be from out of town"

So hard with my girls not around me
Its definitely not a Nashville party
Cause' all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
But something stops me every time (every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

Black dress, with the tights underneath,
I've got the breath of the last cigarette on my teeth.
And she's an actress, but she ain't got no need.
She's got money from parents in a trust fund back east.

Tongues, always pressed to your cheeks.
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth.
Tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef,
That I'm a vegetarian, and I ain't fucking scared of him.

She wants to touch me
She wants to love me
She'll never leave me
Don't trust a ho.
Never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho 
(Cause the ho) won't trust me.

X's on the back of your hands,
Wash them in the bathroom to drink like the bands,
And the set list, you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page.

Bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm,
And the best is, no one knows who you are.
Just another girl alone at the bar.

Shush girl, shut your lips,
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
I said shush girl, shut your lips.
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
I said shush girl, shut your lips.
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.

Feel it comin' in the air (Yeah)
And the screams from everywhere (Yeah)
I'm addicted to the thrill (I'm ready)
It's a dangerous love affair (What's up, c'mon)
Can't be scared when it goes down 
Got a problem, tell me now (What's up)
Only thing that's on my mind (Whats up)
Is who's gonna run this town tonight (What's up)
Is who's gonna run this town tonight (What's up)
We gonna run this town

We are, yeah I said it, we are, 
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get ya'll black tees on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds, ridin' with they Dillingers
I'd get more in depth, if you boys really real enough
This is la familia, I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper, I'm a couple bands down 
And I'm tryin' to get back
I gave the other grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma's, six zeros, dot zeroes here it go, 
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas, now we squared up, hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair 
I break the rules so I don't care 
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain (What's up)
Victory's within the mile, 
Almost there, don't give up now (What's up)
Only thing that's on my mind 
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (What's up)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heyy
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heyy, (What's up)

We are, yeah I said it we are, 
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Czar
Please follow the leader, So Eric B. we are
Microphone fiend, it's the return of the God, peace God 
(Ah! Ah!) And ain't nobody fresher, I'm in Mason 
Martin Margiela, 
On the tape we're screamin' fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a banquet for the broads, they got a table for of fellas 
And they ain't spending no cake
They should throw they hand in, 
'Cause they ain't got no spades 
My whole team got dough
So my banquette is looking like millionaires' row 

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care (What's up)
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile (What's up)
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who gon' run this town tonight (What's up)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heyy
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (What's up)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heyy, 
Is who's gon' run this town tonight?

It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick, no homo
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvo's
Next time I'm in church, please no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This a fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fucking Rav-4?
But I know that if I stay stun-ting
All these girls only gonna want one thing
I could spend my whole life good will hunting
Only good gon' come is as good when I'm coming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting, off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
I'm just trying to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to drop some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
What's that 'Ye? Baby, these heels
Is that a may? What?
Baby, these wheels
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel, (What's up)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, 
Hey hey, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, 
We gonna run this town tonight! 

What's up!

I see your dirty face
High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I'm in mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Yeah!
Wayne's world

Panties drop

And I sing about angels like Angela

And Samantha
And Amanda
And Tamara
MÃ©nage Ã  trois

Mechanic, me, I can fix you up

Big ass rocks like off the ground

As cool as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie

A lovegame

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake id but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You roll the cash out 
And get the hell out of town

Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright
Oh, did we get hitched last night, dressed up like Elvis,
Why, am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
Cause now we're partners in crime

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
And get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me 
Remember what you told me 
Remember what you told me 
Told me, you told me, you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is

That's what you get baby, shake the glitter, shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby

It's your birthday, so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip on weezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good but I know you want to cry out

You say you want passion and I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switchin' positions, you feel so rounded
Tell me where you want your gift, girl?

Girl you know I, girl you know I, I been feenin'

Deep until I know I pleased that body, body
Or girl, without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, body how I do

Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed
You close your eyes as I improv between your legs

Birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex

I don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the mornin'
'Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home

Ah, the sun is blindin'
I stayed up again
Oh, I am findin'
That's not the way I want my story to end

I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside, you're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
'Cause I won't remember, save your breath
'Cause what's the use?

Ah, the night is callin'
And it whispers to me softly, "Come and play"
But I, I am fallin'
And if I let myself go I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside, you're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round
I'm lookin' for myself, sober

Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round
Lookin' for myself, sober

When it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'til it goes bad
'Til you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry 'never again'
Broken down in agony, just tryin' find a friend, oh, oh

I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside, you're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside, you're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's.

Heard you get it poppin', you get it poppin'.

She's starin' at me,
I'm sittin', wonderin' what she's thinkin'.
Nobody's talkin',
'Cause talkin' just turned into screamin'.
And now is I'm yellin' over her,
She's yellin' over me.
All that that means
Is neither of us is listening,
(And what's even worse)
That we don't even remember why were fighting.

So both of us are mad for

Nothin'
(Fighting for).
Nothin'
(Crying for).
Nothin'
(Whoa).
But we won't let it go for
Nothin'
(No not for)
Nothin'.
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.
Oh, baby
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Cant sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you),
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me).
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you),
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
Oh, no, no, no

And it gets me upset, girl
When you're constantly accusing.
(Askin' questions like you've already known).
We're fighting this war, baby
When both of us are losing.
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go).
Whoa,
(What happened to workin' it out)
We've falled into this place
Where you ain't backin' down
And I ain't backin' down.

So what the hell do we do now
It's all for

Nothin'
(Fighting for).
Nothin'
(Crying for).
Nothin'
(Whoa).
But we won't let it go for
Nothin'
(No not for)
Nothin'.
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.
Oh, baby
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can't sleep through the pain)

Oh baby this love ain't gonna be perfect,
(Perfect, perfect, oh oh).
And just how good it's gonna be.
We can fuss and we can fight
Long as everything alright between us
Before we go to sleep.

Baby, we're gonna be happy.

I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can't sleep through the pain).

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming no no no, no no
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na

I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope)
I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight

Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight

[Chorus]
So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Uh, check my flow, uh

The waiter just took my table
And gave to Jessica Simp- (shit!)
I guess I'll go sit with tomboy
At least he'll know how to hit
What if this song's on the radio
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight

Na na na na na na na, he's gonna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, we're all gonna get in a fight!

You weren't there
You never were
You want it all
But that's not fair
I gave you love
I gave my all
You weren't there
You let me fall

No, no, 
No, no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Ba da da da da da

DJ I want everybody to stop what they're doing. 
Now if you know you're with somebody you're gonna take the hotel room tonight, 
Make some noise

Meet me at the hotel room, meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room, meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room, 
You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room. 
Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room, 
You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room.
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn. 
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn.

We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn.

Then we gonna go four and four, we gon' freak some more! But first

Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for,
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders,
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes
I say move a bitch move

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home (to come home)
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand)
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy

Please don't turn me off, yeah, like this, where you at shawty?

You fly as hell, swagga right, brown skin poppin'
You know just how to talk to me
Know just how I like it
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on

Now wait a minute little buster
You got one more time to feel on my booty
Better recognize a lady
That ain't the way you do me
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas give it to me
I gotta be feeling your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman

Going up on it, you acting like you want it
And you stuntin' like your daddy checkin' for this little mama
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on

Now wait a minute little buster
Now you don't even know me but you wanna take me shopping
You a lame, I can tell it ain't big shit poppin
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

All you wanna do is holla at the cutest broad to get up in them draws
Got money, don't try to buy me bottles, got my own dollars

Dime divas give it to me

We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left is good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Everyday, 7 takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
Cause I see sunset in your eyes

That I gotta do it,
I gotta do it,
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it,
I gotta do it,
I gotta do it

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take these tears
I hate this part right here

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like deja vu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

You can't give up, (when you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough (cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many time I've kicked you outta here?
Or said something insulting?
I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything
I can cut you into pieces
When my heart is, broken

Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
I'm always saying how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But baby I don't mean it
I mean it, I promise

I forgot to say out loud how beautiful you really are to me
I can't be without, you're my perfect little punching bag
And I need you, I'm sorry.

Please, please don't leave me

Baby, please don't leave me
No, don't leave me
Please don't leave me 
I'm always saying how I don't need you 
But it's always gonna come right back,
It's gonna come right back to this.
Please, don't leave me.
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please don't leave me
Baby, please don't leave me

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never rule this world
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong
But the strength I have is washing away
It wont be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

Girl I know, mistakes were made between us two
And we show our ass that night even said somethings weren't true
Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was
Cause you were my homie, lover and friend

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

Watching everyday that goes by

Till I get you back I'm gonna cry
Yes I miss you much
Cause you are the apple of my eye
Girl I miss you much

I want you to fly with me
Want you to fly
I miss how you lie with me
Miss how you lie
Just wish you could dine with me
Wish you could dine with me
One that would grind with me
One that would grind with me

I want you to fly with me
Want you to fly
I miss how you lie with me
Oh miss how you lie
Just wish you could dine with me
Wish you could dine
One that would grind with me
Oh one that would grind

Don't try to explain your mind
I know what's happening here
One minute, it's love
And, suddenly, it's like a battlefield

One word turns into a war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield, can't go back, now

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall, again
Why we gotta fall for it, now

I never meant to start a war
You know, I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like

Can't swallow our pride
Neither of us wanna raise that flag, mm
If we can't surrender
Then, we're both gonna lose we have, oh, no

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing (nothing) oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall, again
I don't wanna fall for it, now

I never meant to start a war
You know, I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Better go and get your armor 
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor 
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your

We could pretend that we are friends, tonight (oh)
And, in the morning, we wake up, and we'd be alright
Cause, baby, we don't have to fight
And I don't want this love to feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
I guess you better go and get your armor

I never meant to start a war
You know, I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
I guess you better go and get your armor 
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor 
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
Why does love always feel like (oh, oh)
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield

I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss.

A little mistletoe, sippin' Grand Marnier I'm a fan all day.
Do me that favor, cause I like your flavor.

Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch, 
Shawty that's what's up.

Yep! Yep! Your vision, so, so delicious.

Bottom and top lip, bout to have a sugar feast.
Level with our trip, I'm a lip bitin' beast.
Man for them things, all 42 teeth.
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat.
Ain't your mama slirp, stickin', usin' my tree.

Oh is something about
Just something about the way she move
I can't figure it out
Is something about her

Say, oh is something about
Kinda woman that want you but don't need you
Hey, I can't figure it out
Is something about her

Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicure nails just sent the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly

And she move like a boss
Do what a boss
Do, she got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Oh, the way she shine
Miss independent

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Ooh there's something about
Kinda woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her

Something ooh so sexy about
Kinda woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it, she got it (she said she got it, she got it)
No doubt, there's something about her (there's somethin' about her)

Cause she work like a boss
Play like a boss
Car and the crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And bills are payed on time, yeah
She made for a boss
Only a boss
Anything less she telling them to get lost
That's the girl that's on my mind

Her favorite thing to say, don't worry I got it
And everything she got best believe she bought it
She goin' steal my heart ain't no doubt about it, girl
You're everything I need
Said you're everything I need

Yeah, yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave tear drops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and
Stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach my how to dance
A foxtrot above me head
A sock-hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
(Ha-ha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes

Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss
In every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret
And each goodbye
Was a mistake to great to hide

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes

Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

Across this new divide
Across this new divide

Yea, yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and, since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere I used to cop in Harlem, 
All of my Dominicano's right there up on Broadway, 
Pull me back to that McDonald's, took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wippin' pastry's
Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whattup to Ty-Ty, still sippin' Mai Tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York 

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
Eight million stories, out there in it naked
City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I got a plug, Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three card monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire St. that's

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air everybody say yeah, yeah, 
Yea, yea

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

I've practiced this for hours, gone round and round
And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

It came out like a river once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
Felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to say

Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise

If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today (stayed till today)
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wright and wrong, our memories
The whispering before we sleep,
Just one more thing that you can't keep

Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

S-O-S she is in disguise
S-O-S she is in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise,
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me,
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
Moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body is craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday
And Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution 
or decent incentives to keep me at it
Starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (ahoo)
So I'm gonna go somewhere closer
To get me a lover and tell you about it

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Open up and set her free (ahoo)
There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breath 

Sitting across the bar, staring right at her prey,
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent,
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single man 
I've got on me a special radar,
And the fire department's hot line 
in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divas 
or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
I'm having a very good time 
and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Open up and set her free (ahoo)
There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breath 

S-O-S she is in disguise
S-O-S she is in disguise, 
There's a she wolf in disguise,
Coming out, coming out, coming out

S-O-S she is in disguise
S-O-S she is in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise,
Coming out, coming out, coming out

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breath

Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stunnin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me

Baby girl went AWOL

Turn the lights on

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale; can you hold my hands and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody, pinch me--your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure--I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?

Fallin' for you
Dropping so quickly
Maybe I should
Keep this to myself
Waiting 'til I
Know you better

I am trying
Not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
So I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of
Holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

As I'm standing here
And you hold my hand
Pull me towards you
And we start to dance
All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me

I'm trying
Not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
So I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of
Holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

Oh I just can't take it
My heart is racing
The emotions keep spinning out

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you

'Cause right now you're the only thing that's making any sense to me
And I don't FICA a what they say or what they think, think.
'Cause you're the only one who's on my mind.

I'll never ever let you leave me
I'll try to stop time forever
Never wanna hear you say goodbye.

I feel so untouched and I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you.
I feel so untouched right now, need you so much somehow

Goin' crazy from the moment I met you.

Untouched.

Give me, give me, give me all of you
Don't be scared, of seeing through the loneliness.

Don't even think about what's right or wrong or wrong or right
'Cause in the end it's only you and me
And no one else is going to be around
To answer all the questions left behind
And you and I are meant to be

So even if the world falls down today
You still got me to hold you up up
And I would never let you down down

Untouched

Ah la la la

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

But now it's over

Hot sweat and blurry eyes

Drink my beer and smoke my weed

She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down,
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out,
The dogs were all barking and wagging around,
And I just laughed and said y'all get in,
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair,
She was looking too good not to go somewhere,
Said what you want to do baby I don't care,
We can go to the show we can stay out here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor,
We can go slow or make it go faster,
Down through the woods and out to the pasture,

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to,
Girl you know you got me to hold on to,
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather,
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said we can fire it up and I can show you around,
Sit upon the hill and watch the sun go down,
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out,
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Or we can take you for a ride on my big green tractor,
We can go slow or make it go faster,
Down through the woods and out to the pasture,

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to,

I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Oh yeah yeah,
We can go to town,
Or we can go another round,
On my big green tractor.

Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

No more gas in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane
Yeah

It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight
Your mind is in Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia
Disturbia

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnectin' your call
Your phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort

It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
I feel like a monster

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum

Release me from this curse I'm in
I've been trying to maintain
But I'm struggling
You can't go, go, go
I think I'm going to oh, oh, oh

Do you know what's worth fighting for,
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,

One, twenty one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I

Tell my niggas holla back
Tell your girls good night

You way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you're gonna make a nigga fall in love, love
You way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you're gonna make a nigga fall in love, love

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
With sweet tea, pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

And its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind; this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank god for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.
Salute the ones who died
And the ones that gave their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Aw, baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know?
What's more special than YOU?
You feel me?

It's on, baby let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself, okay that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, I love his big ego
It's too much
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or, you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you're a sight to see
Kinda something like me

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up,
I can back it up
I Walk like this 'cause I can back it up

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego... such a huge ego
But, I love his big ego
It's too much
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up

Ego so big you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay 

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall wit you friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance

Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We're friends worldwide, breakin' all the rules
She like a song played again and again

That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, a dime they say
That girl, is a gun to my holster
She's runnin' through my mind all day, ay

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night til the morn
Girl you really change my life
Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cookin' things she likes

We're friends worldwide, breakin' all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife
That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, a dime they say
That girl, is the gun to my holster
She's runnin' through my mind all day, ay

I can be your melody
Oh girl I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me
Ay, I can be your melody
A girl that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me

Ay, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Shawty got me singin
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Now she got me singin'

I remember, trying not to stare, the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later, in the front porch light
Taking forty-five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
But I thought I loved you then

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl
Like a river meets the sea,
Stronger than it's ever been.
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

And I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you,
You were so surprised
There were people around, but I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there and once again,
I thought I loved you then

But now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe, the way I feel about you, girl
Like a river meets the sea,
Stronger than it's ever been.
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

And I can just see you, with a baby on the way
And I can just see you, when your hair is turning gray
What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more
But I've said that before

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl
We'll look back someday, at this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

Oh what the hell she says
I just can't win for losing
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now

By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night
Can make you blind
I can just imagine
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

And she says, oh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

Way down

Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
But it don't feel right

By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

She shuts out the night
Tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
She'll be alright
She'll be alright
Just not tonight

And she says, oh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win it
Hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling

(I can't take no more)
(Diamonds on the floor)
(No more) no more
(No more)
Diamonds falling down
(I can't take no more)
(Diamonds on the floor)
(No more, no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down, yeah
(I can't take no more)
(Diamonds on the floor)
(No, no, no, no)
Oh diamonds fall, and oh her diamonds
Diamonds falling down
I can't take these diamonds falling down

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
Been missing you crazy
How do you do
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep.

I tried my best at moving on have yet to find a girl like you
I see things that I didn't before and I'm wishing I had more time with you,
How do you stay awake knowing all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about that never will happen again if I could just see you

If I had my way I'll get'cha girl 
In your favorite car with the missing top
Around my way where we used to park and did all those things.

How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep

Baby all that I hear from my friends again and again (they come and ask about you) (they say) 
We saw your girl at the game and dang we gotta say a big mistake by you.
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't sleep can't think can't eat till I come see you

If I had my way I'll get'cha girl 
In your favorite car with the missing top 
Around my way where we used to park and did all those things.

One, two, three

Oh

It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
In your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah nigga I'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness,
Bitches,

Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came,
I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't,
You're such a fucking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back,

OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's,
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last,

There they go, packing stadiums,
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow,
We can make them look like bozos,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
Fuck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
And spit true feelings,
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face,
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake.

Me plus you, I'm a tell you one time
Me plus you, I'm a tell you one time
Me plus you, I'm a tell you one time

One time
One time

When I met you girl my heart went knock knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop

I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slippin' right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
When it all starts coming undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you, whoa oh, oh I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you, I run to you yeah, whoa whoa, oh I run to you, I run to you girl

I run to you

I always run to you
Run to you
Run to you

Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it
Slow motion, sparks, you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it, but boys will be boys, oh, yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last but this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say

'Cause I feel, the distance
Between us, could be over
With the snap of your finger, Oh, no!

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight
To say, 'cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight, to say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
'Cause you don't wanna miss out

Give me the green light, give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Working your back like it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
I've got an obsession of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission so just

Give me the green light, give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night, give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

One two three green light, but if it's what it seems like
The you moving baby, lets me know it's gon' be right
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

One two three red light, I wanna see what you dance like
But if I can be your buddy, help you study and get your head right
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

Do I have a girlfriend, technically no.
If you'll be my girlfriend then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition, no others
Baby it's just the thrill of the chase
But I've got a feeling that I'm winning this race!
Baby I'm gettin' closer, I just need permission so

Give me the green light, give me just one night.
I'm ready to go right now! I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night, give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

One two three green light, but if it's what it seems like
The you moving baby, lets me know it's gon' be right
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

One two three red light, I wanna see what your dance like
But if I can be your buddy, get your study and get your head right
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

So I went hard like Medusa staring at me
I told her let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory
She said, What type of girl do you think I are
The kind that you meet in a bar
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kinda star
No I'm a comet, I just want you woman
Hey, If I were you then It would be me that I go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl "ooh he can get it" admit it, 
You did it let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kiddin' we both going to where you livin'
Ha, I got you gigglin' like I'm piglet
Oh that's the ticket, I hope you are more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady so let me quit it
I'm just style freein', freestylin' with y'all seldom do
This is what I'm telling you
To the bed I'm nailing you
Like I've been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

Give me the green light, give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night, give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now

This old man and me, were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and swaping 'I don't cares'
Talking politics, blond and red-head chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace and all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say;
"God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"

He said "I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damned if I know"
We talked an hour or two about every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said "These damn things will kill me yet;
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"

Last call its two a.m., I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day, I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary, he was a millionaire
He left his fortune to some guy he barely knew, his kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today, to just say thanks and pray, 
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave and I said; 
'God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy"

God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy.

God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy.

She's got eyes that cut you like a knife and
Lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

'Cause when she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
'Cause when she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you" (I do)
You got whatever it is

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even without fists held high, yeah
Never would have worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you now
I can't stop

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
Started with a perfect kiss
Then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone
Already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone

Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

Oh, oh

Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

Yeah

Remember all these things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that its wrong
I'm already gone
Already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone

Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act
And you don't know where your life is going
Am I supposed to be torn apart, broken hearted, in a corner crying?
Pardon me if I don't show it
I don't care if I never see you again
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together,
But either way baby, I'm gone

I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wondering
I got that new
I'm a single girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye

Cut my hair 'cuz it reminded me of you
I know you like the long 'do,
Had to switch my attitude up
Thinkin' of changing up how I ride, No more
On the passenger side
Too bad you miss out on the way that I drive it
I don't care if I never see you again
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together,
But either way baby, I'm gone

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Goodbye

Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Goodbye

This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

I say hey, I be gone today
But I be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing, that I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and girl
Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well I hoped it was you
And when I looked into your eyes I knew it was true

I say hey, I be gone today
But I be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing, that I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned
You can bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My Momma told me don't lose you
'cause the best luck I had was you

I say hey, I be gone today
But I be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing, that I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

And I said rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I said hey momma, hey momma close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I said hey trippa hey trippa close to you
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I said hey Momma close to you
Rocking in the dance hall I said, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma

My Momma told me don't lose you
'cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing, that I love you

I say hey, I be gone today
But I be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing for sure
I love you, I love you, I love you

Ether boy! Hey!

How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancing on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!

We need more bottles tell ma hurry up
Tell 'em Ron Browz here hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can get it up
On my neck on my wrist everything is litted up
Drinking bottles of that Clique 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up
(Hey!) If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

When I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that?)
Brand new 'rarri and the roof drop back (The 60)
Came through Harlem like the Rooftop back 
Money in the bank man you know don't stop that (Stop that stop that stop that!)
(Oh!) Now we trying to get up in the club
(Oh!) Try to tell me no cause I'm rolling with the thugs
(We got money bitch!) Until I flash a couple of dollars (Yep!)
Tell 'em we only want tables and we buying out the bottles
(Oh!) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right!)
Only Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standing on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was balling hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet with my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way
Shit! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stopping at the light

Baby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mami got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you she lyin' but she fake it
When she with me she like it she never fake it

I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around

I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into like
Baby believe me; I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep till I die a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times
Better days, I miss you more and more

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around.

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, pretty wings
Pretty wings, pretty wings
Pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without
And just hold a smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time and time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go

Picture you're the queen of everything
Far as the eye can see
Under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
Steady your hand

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time, time and time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go

We're falling apart,
And we're coming together,
Again and again
We're crawling apart,
But we're falling together,
Falling together
Together again

Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
