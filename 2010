Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy (Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door; I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CD's
Rollin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tried to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Now, the party don't start till I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Picture perfect memories,
Scattered all around the floor,
Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it any more.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.

Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.
I just need you now.
Oh baby I need you now.

Hey, hey, hey

Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I let you go and blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream, I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo, 
The way you move ain't fair, you know!
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction, a game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out of my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Well you can cut a rug, watching you's the only drug I need
So gangsta, I'm so thug, you're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see, I can be myself now finally, in fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be, with me

Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, 
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Tonight

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet n' wild

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night skies
Like shooting stars
I can really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(Dreamin', I'm fallin, dreamin', I'm fallin')

Lets pretend like its 98, like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now lets pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (OK)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Lets try to use imagination

OK, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had a dream of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now lets pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

(And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream, but those days are gone they're just memories)

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that 
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, 
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward but as strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as sh-t
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
F-ck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to sh-t quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this sh-t
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
Cause he never risked sh-t he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap he ain't even here he pretends that

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate 
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, 
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em, 
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em, 
Now you're in each others face, 
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em, 
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways, 
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, 
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave, 
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you, 
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk, 
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)
With no directions just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
An' so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly I ended up with none

There's so much nonsense
It's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
(That you wanna know)
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go)

And you keep it real while them other stay plastic
You're my Wonder Women call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia to New Orleans
But you always steal the show (steal the show)

You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin'

And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bub

Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster

'Cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector 
Sorry, I cannot answer

Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired
Of my phone ringin'
Sometimes I feel like
I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls

You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down

Before you met me 
I was alright but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe this, is, real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream

In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight 
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
I say

When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing 
Just the way you are 
And when you smile 
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing 
Just the way you are 
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing 
Just the way you are 
And when you smile 
The whole world stops and stares for a while 
'Cause girl you're amazing 
Just the way you are 

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing 
Just the way you are 

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing 
Just the way you are 
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise

Shh, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are 

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love

You got your high brow, switchin' your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise

Shh, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are 

'Cause it's your scene, (it's your scene)
I got no doubt
We all see
You got your head in the clouds

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm

Futuristic musically
Power will full with energy
From the soul we sonically
Sending positivity

Yea, yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and, since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere I used to cop in Harlem, 
All of my Dominicano's right there up on Broadway, 
Pull me back to that McDonald's, took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wippin' pastry's
Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whattup to Ty-Ty, still sippin' Mai Tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York 

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
Eight million stories, out there in it naked
City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I got a plug, Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three card monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire St. that's

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air everybody say yeah, yeah, 
Yea, yea

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
Yeah, a different city every night oh right
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh right
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire

I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the five, twenties tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh every time I close my eyes I see my name in shining lights 
A different city every night all right 
I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire 
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire

I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad!

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (Yeah)
To take a stand, It's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to 
Go to that place 
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me, 
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it, 
I don't give a damn what you think, 
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans, 
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'm a be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin', 
Whether he's on salary paid hourly until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt, 
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand) 
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, 
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings, 
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans, 
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, 
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how, 
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out 
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows, me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand) 
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, 
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'm a face my demons
I'm manning up, I'm a hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead, 
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on, 
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it, 
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it! 'Cause the way I feel, 
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub, 
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand) 
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay 

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall wit you friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance

Who would have ever knew

Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cookin' things she likes

We're friends worldwide, breakin' all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

Her best days will be some of my worst
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you,
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,
I'm falling to pieces

They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving
And when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven even, no

What am I gonna to do when the best part of me was always you,
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,
I'm falling to pieces
(One still in love while the other ones leaving)
I'm falling to pieces
('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)

Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase, I took the blame
Now I'm try'na make sense of what little remains ooh
'Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break
No it don't break
No it don't breakeven no

What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you and
What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK

('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)

Oh it don't breakeven no
Oh it don't breakeven no
Oh it don't breakeven no

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I've got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hitting my head against the wall

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Gotta look to my own advice
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My sleep is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack head

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug, uh, your drug
Uh, your drug, is my love your drug?

Hey, hey so? Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug
I like your beard

I gotta feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night

Go out and smash it like oh my God
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get off

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out and losing all control

Fill up my cup, Mazel Tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave tear drops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and
Stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach my how to dance
A foxtrot above me head
A sock-hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
(Ha-ha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

Aye, when I give you these keys homeboy don't move my car man
I ride in the front ya dig
Don't move my shit man
Oh! oh baby what's your name

Tryin' to get you home or would you be Marge Simpson
Whip out front we could leave like pronto
Maple leaf dash got you feelin' like Toronto
Make your body rise like your puffin on a joint though
Girl that's only if you want though (you ready)

Say aah (aah, aah, aah, aah)
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say aah (aah, aah, aah, aah) 
(It's loso, you might be too drunk to know so)
You want me say aah (aah, aah, aah, aah)

I make 'em say aah
Just like I'm your doctor
All I prescribe
Is cranberry and vodka
Them I'm tryna kick it
Play a little soccer
And bust a couple off
Blacka blacka
The Henny in ya system
You start drunk texting
And suddenly you miss him
Or even wanna diss him
Then you call your girl like
What the hell you gave me
She like don't blame me
You better do like Jamie
And blame it on the liquor
He works every time
Patron you my nigga
Know its somebody birthday
Well where ya
And I know you thirsty
But don't know where your glass at

[Repeat: x2]
Go girl, 
It's your birthday
Open wide, 
I know your thirsty
Say aah (aah, aah, aah, aah)
Say aah (aah, aah, aah, aah)
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say aah (aah, aah, aah, aah)
If you want me say aah (aah, aah, aah, aah)

I'm more than just an option 
(hey, hey, hey) 
Refuse to be forgotten 
(hey, hey, hey) 
I took a chance with my heart 
(hey, hey, hey) 
And I feel it taking over 

I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I bet if I give all my love 
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart 

I'm more than just a number 
(hey, hey, hey) 
I doubt you'll find another 
(hey, hey, hey) 
So every single summer 
(hey, hey, hey) 
I'll be the one that you remember 

I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I bet if I give all my love 
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart 

It's more than just a mission 
(hey, hey, hey) 
You hear but you don't listen 
(hey, hey, hey) 
You better pay attention 
(hey, hey, hey) 
And get what you been missing 

I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I bet if I give all my love 
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart 

Too many times I've been wrong 
I guess being right takes too long 
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do 
But give all I have to you and 
I better find your lovin' 
I better find your heart 
I better find your lovin' 
I bet if I give all my love 
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart 

I bet if I give all my love 
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart.

I know that we are young,
And I know that you may love me,
But I just can't be with you like this anymore,
Alejandro

Nothing to lose

I was thinking bout her, thinkin' bout me
Thinkin' bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah, it was only Just A Dream
So I traveled back, down that road
Will she come back, no one knows
I realize yeah, it was only Just A Dream

I was at the top and now its like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

When I be ridin' man I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hopes she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

But how low can you go?

Practice in front of that mirror,

Till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,

Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,

I'm not surprised
Not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times,
I stopped keepin' track.
Talk myself in
I talk myself out
I get all worked up
Then I let myself down.

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought, I thought of every possibility

And I know someday that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

I might have to wait
I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing
And the other half's luck
Wherever you are
Whenever it's right
You come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

Mmm

But somehow I know that will all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid, I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all's fair
In love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right
And we'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

Mmm

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work, to work it out
Promise you kid, I'll give more than I get
Than I get, than I get, than I get

Oh you know it will all turn out
And you'll make me work, so we can work, to work it out
And I promise you kid, to give so much more than I get
Yeah I just haven't met you yet

I just haven't met you yet
Oh promise you kid
To give so much more than I get

I said love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
I just haven't met you yet
Love, love, love, love, love, love 
I just haven't met you yet

You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out

Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now 
The club can't even handle me right now 

Hey

You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down, down, down

So leave it behind cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me, as we make our great escape (So why don't we run away)

So baby don't worry, you are my only

She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature, cause to me she zero degrees
She cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier please
I'm fighting for this girl
On a battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid sendin' arrows from above
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly I'm down like the economy, yeah

So baby don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down, down, down
Baby are you down down down down down, down, down
Even if the sky is falling down

Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun; don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in

Burning bridges shore to shore
I'll break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap

Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun; don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

This time, baby, I'll be
Bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be
Bulletproof

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead

Do, do, do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are heard
There's certain things that should be left unsaid

Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out

I won't let you turn around 
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

This time baby
I'll be
Bulletproof
This time baby
I'll be
Bulletproof

What did she say

I was so wrong for so long
Only tryin' to please myself (myself)
Girl I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else
So no I know I should of treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever

So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me girl

Whatchu say, whatchu say
What did she say

How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go (love go)

And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me, 'til you wake me from this bad dream

Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She know she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye, 
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it

(I can see it now)

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la (yeah)
La la la la

I want you to love me, 
Like I'm a hot ride (uh yeah)
Keep thinkin' of me (uh)
Doin' what you like
So boy forget about the world 
'Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight (yeah)
I wanna make your beg for it, 
Then Imma make you swallow your pride

Want you to make me feel 
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands 
How to make you feel like a man

Yeah,
Want you to make me feel 
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one

Want you to take it
Like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, 
Make me feel right
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets 
That I'm keepin', you can come inside (yeah)
And when you enter, you ain't leavin', 
Be my prisoner for the night, oh

Want you to make me feel 
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world

'Cause I'm the only one who understands 
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh make it last all night, night

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise

How to make you feel like a man

Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world

Sometimes we fall down and can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough
'Til it's too late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've done

Yeah gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given here
This is all we got then we gotta start thinkin' it
Every second counts on a clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying oh

We only got 86 400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying oh

Well if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye
Should be so careful who we left out of our lives
So when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the line

Yeah we gotta start lookin' at the hands of the time we've been given here
This all we got then we gotta start thinkin' it
Every second counts on a clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying oh

We only got 86 400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

Like we're dying oh
Like we're dying 
Like we're dying oh
Like we're dying 

We only got 86 400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying oh

You never know a good thing until it's gone
You never see a crash until it's head on
Why we think we're right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing 'til it's gone

Yeah we gotta start lookin' at the hands of the time we've been given here
This all we got and we gotta start thinkin' it
Every second counts on a clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying oh

We only got 86 400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

Like we're dying oh
Like we're dying 
Like we're dying oh
Like we're dying 

We only got 86 400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup, you know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't no need in tryin'
I live where the sky ends, yup, you know this
Never lyin', truth teller
That Rihanna reign, just won't let up
All black on, blacked out shades
blacked out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion, as in
Goin' til they say stop
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, 
I betta let ya' know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard) ah yeah, yeah, yeah,

All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top (Top, top) Gettin' loaded
Who think they test me now
Run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that, hope that ain't all you got
I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that (All on me like that) yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let ya' know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard) ah yeah, yeah, yeah,

I'm so hard (So hard) ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
I'm so hard (Too hard)
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red dogs will give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my own block like Obama did
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then
You couldn't even come in my room, it smelled like a kilo
Looked like me and two of my boys playing casino
Trying to sell they peeping my bag they can't afford it
Tell 'em to give me back my swag, they tryin' to clone me
See my Louis tux, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in an all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac a wrist
Yeah, they say they're hard
They ain't hard as this
Hard! The one word describes me, if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard

Where dem girls talkin' trash, where dem girls talkin' trash
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where dem bloggers at, where dem bloggers at
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where your lighters at, where your lighters at
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I, I'm so hard yeah, yeah, yeah,

Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man,

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut,
I'll be fine,
I'm forever young

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Fear not when, fear not why,
Fear not much while were alive,
Life is for living not living up tight,
See ya somewhere up in the sky,
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye,
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here,
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here,
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears,
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know.
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Slamming Bentley doors,
Hopping out of Porsche's,
Popping up on Forbes lists,
Gorgeous,
Hold up,
Niggas thought I lost it,
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit
They nauseous,
Hold up,
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit,
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit,
Less than four bars,
Guru bring the chorus in,
Did you get the picture yet,
I'm painting you a portrait of young

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young
Forever and ever

And we'll fight for you like we were soldiers

But soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name

Do you think I'm special, do you think I'm nice
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces
Between the noise you hear and the sound you like
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces

It can't be possible that rain can fall,
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over the world it's said, they've got, they've got

All the right friends, in all the right places
So yeah we're going down
We got all the right moves in all the right places
So yeah we're going down

Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going

Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say
I know I could never face
Someone that could sound like you

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

I can't go any further than this
I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

I spent my time just thinking thinking thinking bout you
Every single day yes, I'm really missin' missin' you
And all those things we use to use to use to do
Hey girl, whats up, it use, it use to be just me and you
I spent my time just thinking thinking thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes I'm really missing missing you
And all those things we use to use to use to do
Hey girl whats up, whats up, whats up, whats up

Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline
Is where I'm gonna wait, for you
I'll be looking out, night n' day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish

Girl, I travel round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe I go to other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna to meet
I navigate myself myself to take me where you be
Cause girl I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown town I travel downtown
I wanna to have you around round like every single day

Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait, for you

Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish

Let's walk the bridge, to the other side
Just you and I (just you and I)
I will fly, I'll fly the skies, for you and I (for you and I)
I will try, until I die, for you and I, for you and I, for for you and I,
For for you and I, for for you and I, for you and I

I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish

There's a place downtown,
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all

When the dark off the night comes around
That's the time, that the animal comes alive
Looking for something wild

And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans-Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a

There's a place downtown,
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on
When they take it off, when they take it off everybody take it off

There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes, in the crowd
We're delirious tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around

N-now we're getting so smashed
Knocking over trash cans
Everybody breakin' bottles
It's a filthy hot mess
Gonna get laid I'm not the designated
Driver so I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a

There's a place downtown,
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on, when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on, when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

Oh, oh, oh! Everybody take it off! Oh, oh, oh!

Everybody take it off!
Right now! take it off! Right now! take it off! Right now! take it off! Oh

And they turn me on
When they take it off, when they take it off everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on, when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

I know way too many people here right now 
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over

Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off, in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over

One thing 'bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I probly still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin' I'm a quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin', man?
Man, nobody's never done it like I did it (Ugh)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied

Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin' heavier
I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it

Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight

Here we go again

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh

What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much
Deeper then they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

You say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting there
Don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

(Girl you really got me bad)
(You really got me bad)
(I'm gonna get you back)
(Gonna get you back)

I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When I hit the flow, the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants presto magic

Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me

These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse--I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time-travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes, and
I see Mindfreak like, "What's up man? What's happenin'?"
So come one, come all and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no Ghost or Poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio--I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold (yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow, the girls come snappin' at me (they be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic

Well, take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme, I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ego
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you're saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold (yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow, the girls come snappin' at me (they be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants presto magic

We are the crowd 
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on it's true
Need that picture of you
It's so magical
We'd be so fantastical

Leather and jeans
We're rock glamorous

Papa-paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar

Baby you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be a girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah 'cause you're my
Rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that baby I

Real good

Snap snap to

'Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down, tie me down 
You ain't gon' tie me down 
You ain't gon' tie me down

But a, it's kinda been forever since we been in 
The kinda situation not involving other women 
And it's pretty obvious that you're kinda trippin', like 
"Who the hell is this bitch lookin' a hot mess 
What you fell for this chick" 
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it 
I'm like, "you need to go somewhere else with this shit 
Because I ain't gon' put up wit you 
Talkin' bout how she make you uncomfortable 
I mean, shit I'm only 17 
And um, a perfect couples only in a dream 
And right now I'm pretty much away for this relationship 
I think we should wait for it 
I mean later we can try things out 
But not right now

Yea you cute, so what

Baby girl one hundred,I ain't tryna do that 
Got too many girls and I ain't letting go 
'Cause my life is great and you ain't nothin' but a hoe 
Yea you come to my shows and you very supportive

He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through the Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep the wave on swim
Wa' waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love 'em, I love 'em, jus' like I raised him
When he call me momma, lil' momma, I call him baby

our love, your love 

He they type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubber band
Just left money gram in the lemon Lam'
Hot damn make me scream like summer jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway I think I met him in the sky
When I was a geisha he was a samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
"S" on my chest lemme get my cape on
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
Konvict, just like Akon
Cause you know snitches be puttin' the Jake on

Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love
Your love, your love, your love
Baby, your the illest (illest, illest)
Your love (love, love)
Your love (love, love)

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess,
Whoa, am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in the cab,
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And the Jay Z song was on
And the Jay Z song was on
And the Jay Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song,
And the butterflies fly away
Noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up,
They're playin' my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA

Get to the club in a taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like "who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?
She's gotta be from out of town"

So hard with my girls not around me
Its definitely not a Nashville party
Cause' all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
But something stops me every time (every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

All the bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up 
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm 'bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, 
say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye, 
say bye bye, say bye bye to her 

Uh, use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind
Fuck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some

'Cause when it's all said and done, 
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big but it beat quiet
how never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond

Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu

And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me
Oh

Babe, pick a night
To come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?

Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?

Are you in
Livin' in sin is the new thing (yeah)
Are, you in
I am countin'

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me
Oh

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me
Oh

Three is a charm
Two is not the same
I don't see the harm
So are you game?

Lets' make a team
Make 'em say my name
Lovin' the extreme
Now are you game?

Are, you in
Livin' in sin is the new thing
Are, you in
I am countin'

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothin' meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it you and me
You and me
Or three
Or four
On the floor!

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me
Oh

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me
Oh

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know (I know)
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Ooh impossible (yeah yeah)

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof top
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy (I was happy)
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
In your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah nigga I'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness,
Bitches,

Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came,
I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't,
You're such a fucking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back,

OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's,
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last,

There they go, packing stadiums,
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow,
We can make them look like bozos,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
Fuck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
And spit true feelings,
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face,
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake.

I remember what you wore on our first date
You came into my life
And I thought hey
You know this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one

I remember every look upon your face,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believin'

And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one



I remember what you wore on the first date
You came into my life
And I thought hey

Maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking

Oooh I can't live without you
'Cause baby two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Two, is better than one

Two is better than one

My first kiss went a little like this
Mwah mwah and twist
Mwah mwah and twist

Well my first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

I said no more teachers
And no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers
Hoping that nobody looked
Lips like licorice
Tongue like candy
Excuse me miss but can I get you out your panties

In the back of the car, 
on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips
(I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh

My first kiss went a little like this

I said no more sailors and no more soldiers
With your name in a heart tattooed up on the shoulders
Your kiss is like whiskey, it gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning with the taste of your tongue

In the back of the car on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips
(I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh

My first kiss went a little like this
And twist, and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist

Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh,

Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even without fists held high, yeah
Never would have worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you now
I can't stop

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
Started with a perfect kiss
Then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone
Already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone

Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

Oh, oh

Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

Remember all these things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

I want you to know

And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that its wrong
I'm already gone
Already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone

I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
Til' all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time, don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
I don't really like my flow, no, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that are like those years
Sick of all the insincere
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time, don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics never jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Oh, got no reason, got no shame
Got no family I can't blame
Just don't let me disappear

So tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears

All my secrets away, all my secrets away

Naturally

How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally
It comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive you don't have to try
It comes naturally, hmm it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay bay baby

You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally 
It comes naturally, hmm yeah

And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)
What you do, so naturally 

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay bay baby
Bay bay bay baby

When we collide, sparks fly
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away
(It takes my breath away) (you are!) 

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I know it's meant to be

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay baby
Bay bay baby

Everything baby comes naturally

Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready

I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready

Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there

Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies 
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is

Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get your mug right (mug right)
We come together holding hands and holla thug life (thug life)
We all strapped in all black
It's like fuck life
(All we do is win)
You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right,

Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
Bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win

Yeah
Cash money heroes 
Private jets
Polish, then shine, fly

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it 
I made it
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it 
I made it

Known from the city where no one believed in me
But I never gave up the fight, yeah
But now I'm on top
I told you to let it rock (rock)
Now money's falling from the sky
I made it

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it 
I made it
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it 
I made it

Rooftop
Hella chopper burnin' smoke
Louie bags stay strapped with a priceless globe
High life
Flippin' and get some more
Paradise
The luxury marble floor
When I hit
Nigga hit me full of that cash
More money than I seen in a garbage can
Stunna island
Money and the power
That's how we do it
Make it rain make it shower
Top floor
Big timer doing big things
Over city view
Bought shorty new range
Flip another hundred 
Poppin throwing hundreds 
In a new Bentley
Uptown stunna

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it 
I made it
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it 
I made it

Oh yeah, I made it
I made it (I made it)
I made it
I-I-I made it
Yo ay ay ay listen

(Jay Sean)
See I don't live for glam
And I don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me then
Now they're calling my name
Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I done gone platinum 
Everything turned around
And now the sky is falling down

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it 
I made it
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it 
I made it

(Lil Wayne)
Come from the gutter
Lookin' like my motha'
Made it to the goal line 
Straight out the huddle
Cash money goldmine
But Weezy stay loyal
Boy we gettin' money like we just found oil
And that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bedrash
And I just tell 'em to loaf it
When the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the world if I change hands
It feel good to be here
Weezy in the building
Got this bitch rebuilt
Young Money

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it 
I made it
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it 
I made it

I look up to the sky (I made it)
Yeah, I made it
I made it (I made it)
I made it
I-I-I made it
Made it, I made it I made it
Yes I did
Yes I did (yes I did)
Yes I did (yes I did)
I-I-I made it

Absolutely no one who knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together

When everybody
Everybody said we never would
And just when I 
I start to think they're right
That love has died

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time,
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go

I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby 
We're stuck like glue

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby 
We're stuck like glue

Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right
Fight about it all night

Had enough
You give me that look
I'm sorry baby let's make up
You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go

I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby 
We're stuck like glue

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby 
We're stuck like glue

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You almost stay out
Too stuck together from the A-T-L

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Feeling kinda sick
Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick

I say, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What'cha gonna do with that
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Come on over here with that 
Sugar sticky sweet stuff
Come on give me that stuff
Everybody want some
Melodies that get stuck

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothin' made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Oh oh yeah yeah oh 
Today was a fairytale

This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, But I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby

Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you we're a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can’t help it if you're really ashamed
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
But I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby

I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby

Turn the lights on

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale; can you hold my hands and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody, pinch me--your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure--I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?

Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody

Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody

I've been roaming around,
Always looking down at all I see

Should've known by the way you pass me by
There was something in your eyes
And it wasn't right
I should've walked but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand and I let it slide
Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way it was before I saw your face

You stole my happy
You made me cry
You took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna un un un un undo it
You had my heart now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it
You put me through it
I wanna un un un un undo it
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name and I never will
And all your things well I threw them in the trash
And I'm not even sad
Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no you'll never change

You want my future you can't have it
Still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

You stole my happy
You made me cry
You took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna un un un un undo it
You had my heart now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it
You put me through it
I wanna un un un un undo it

You stole my happy
You made me cry
You took the lonely and took me for a ride
Boy you blew it
You put me through it
I wanna un un un un undo it

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood Co.? 
I'm with Marley G, bro
Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know
This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow
And uh, my real friends never hearin' from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sippin', so this shit is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on, it's Young Money, motherfucker
If you ain't runnin' wit' it, run from it, motherfucker, all right
Now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple-A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me

N, now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on, it's Young Money, motherfucker
If you ain't runnin' wit' it, run from it, motherfucker, all right
Now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Uh, how do he say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, 
I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin' off tour 
'cause I made more off my second leg
Ma'fuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor
Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled at? 
From where they make gumbo at
Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack
But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on, it's Young Money, motherfucker
If you ain't runnin' wit' it, run from it, motherfucker, all right
Now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig? (Soo woo!)
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

(We on, young young mula baby)

I know they say you can't go home again
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam
But these handprints on the front steps are mine

Up those stairs in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself

If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From Better Homes and Gardens magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself

If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home and you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this old world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself

If I could walk around I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song 
Uh oh uh oh 

Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when 
She stands under my colours, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no 
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin.
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song 

The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man 
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar 
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin' 
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song 
Uh oh (uh oh)

The ballad of a dove 
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em oh

The sharp knife of a short life, 
Well I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls

When I was younger
I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart
And I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist, but darlin'

You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception

Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
But keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness

Because none of it was ever worth the risk

But, you are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know your leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception

You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing.

She grew up on a side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good
She grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin'
But wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race
Of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yea

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey

Ooo there's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin's sweeter than summertime
And American honey 
And American honey

Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em, but I never asked
So let me thank you for your time, 
And try not to waste anymore of mine
And get out of here fast

I hate to break it to you babe, but I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost with no direction
But you'll never see
You're so busy making masks with my name on them in all caps
You got the talking down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

All my life I've tried to make everybody happy
While I just hurt and hide
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

Let me hold your crown, babe

Ten miles from town
And I just broke down
Spitting out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone
Just trying to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know
Believe me, I won't stop at nothing to see you
So I've started running

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
And I think that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked
The night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back
Of my mind
I must have been high
To say you and I weren't meant to be
And just wasting my time
Oh why did I ever doubt you
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
And I think that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong
There's no other one
After this time spent alone
It's hard to believe
That a man with sight could be so blind
Thinking about the better times
Must've been out of my mind
So I'm running back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you

And I think that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
I know there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you ya

You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler then the flip side of my pillow, that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me,
Lets me know that it's OK, yeah it's OK
And the moments where my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack and just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Don't know how I lived without you
Cause every time that I get around ya
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
Oh, you make me smile
Oh, you make me smile

Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me

And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time, you were telling me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever try sleeping with a broken heart?
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you

You wore the crown, you made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me, need me
I thought you told me, you'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
Then I knew right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you
Right till the end

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Well the truth,
Well it hurts to say,
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin' back
Girl but before I get to go and I got to say
I know you used to love me
But that was yesterday
And the truth I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin' you got to do what's right

Whoa lover, lover, lover,
You don't treat me no good no more
Whoa lover, lover, lover,
You don't treat me no good no more

Well the truth,

And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin' back
Girl but before I get to go and I got to say
There was a time oh woman
When you used to shake it for me
Now all you do is just treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more
Gonna walk out the door

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more,
No good no more, more, more
Lover lover lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Oh woman oh woman you know I love you so but
You're so mean to me baby I'm walkin' out the door

Lover oh lover 
Yeah, yeah 
No good no more, more, more

But now I'm givin' it up
