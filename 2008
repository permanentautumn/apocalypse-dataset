Shawty had them Apple Bottom Jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reebok's with the straps (the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (a smack)
She hit the floor
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low low

I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go, this crazy, all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I whoa
Did I think I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

Hey
Shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans full of gwap and they ready for stones
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack (come on)
Two stacks (come on)
Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand)
What you think I'm playin' baby girl
I'm the man, I'll ain't dealin' rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was ova, that henny and Cola got me like a Soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her, like a pornography poster she showed her

Whoa shawty
Yea she was worth the money
Lil mama took my cash, and I ain't want it back
The way she bit that rag, got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack, I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman, let me shownin'
They be want it two in the mornin'
I'm zonin' in them rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
shawty did that pop and lock, had to break her off that gwap
Gal was fly just like my glock

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough, but it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen
But something happened, for the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal, is to keep me from falling
But nothings greater, than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me, thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars, for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights

I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try try to divide something so real
So til the end of time I'm telling you there is no one 

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late, whoa

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?

If I should die before I wake
Its 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Is there a way I could make you understand?

But how
Do you expect me, to live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air air, No air air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew right off
The ground and float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down, for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Got me here out in the water so deep

Tell me how you goin' be without me?

If you ain't here I just can't breathe

There's no air, no air
No air air, no air air

Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that

You made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's 
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better reason to write you a love song today

I learned the hard way 
That they all say things you want to hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's 
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better reason to write you a love song today

Promise me that you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone 
'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me because I say

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
Is that why you wanted a love song
'Cause you asked for it 
'Cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that there's a reason to 
Write you a love song today

Gotta do it for the ladies

Standin' ovation

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
(Please)
Just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone
(You better hurry up)
Before the sprinklers come on
Talkin' 'bout "Girl, I love you you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
(Please)
What else is on?

And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

And the award for the best liar goes to you
For makin' me believe
That you could be
Faithful to me
Let's hear your speech out
Oh

How 'bout a round of applause?
Standin' ovation

But it's over now

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never rule this world
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what, good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

Hey Jill
You know them old sugar daddy
They be trickin' they tell them girl

I said you could have whatever you like (if you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (if you like)
Yeah

Stacks on deck
Patrone on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And baby you could have whatever you like (if you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (if you like)
Yeah
Late night sex so wet so tight
I'll gas up a jet for you tonight
And baby you could go where ever you like (if you like)
I said you could go where ever you like (if you like)

You know it ain't nothin' to drop a couple stacks on you
Wanted you could get it my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentley's I swear

Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it I got it, go get it I buy it

Brain so good (good) I swore you went to college
Hundred deposit, vacations hit the tropics

Ya need to never ever gotta go in your wallet
Long as I got rubber band banks in my pocket
Five six, rides with rims and a body kit
Ya ain't gotta downgrade you can get what I get
My chick could have what she want
And goin' every store for any bag she want
And know she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything ya heart desire I that
Yeah I want your body, I need yo body

All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane
Yeah

It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight
Your mind is in Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia
Disturbia

You're makin' staying over here impossible

Will you count me in?

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

It starts in my toes, and I crinkle my nose
Where ever it goes I always know
That you make me smile, please, stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under covers stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

It starts in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile, please, stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

But what am I gonna say?
When you make me feel this way
I just, mmm

And it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile, please, stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tucked me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul, and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever you go I always know
'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while

MC, you're the place to be
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I know that you've been waitin' for it
I'm waiting too
In my imagination I'd be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me
Hundred and two
And boy I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof

If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me

About this secret rendezvous

Between you and I

Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around

Touch my body
Throw me on the bed

All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body

And touch my body.

Than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me
Like a tropical breeze
And float away with you
In the Caribbean Sea

I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money

And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight

Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight

So, so what?

I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Uh, check my flow, uh

The waiter just took my table
And gave to Jessica Simp- (shit!)

At least he'll know how to hit
What if this song's on the radio
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight

Na na na na na na na, he's gonna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, we're all gonna get in a fight!

You weren't there
You let me fall

No, no, 
No, no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Ba da da da da da

I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good

It's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing

Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining
A dark lit place
For your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun

I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks

That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining
A dark lit place
For your place or my place

You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it

The first time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me, mmm, mmm
Play it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mmm, mmm

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
So in love with you

She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh no)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh how)
She can't help it

Can't breath, when you touch my sleeve
Butterflies so crazy, ummm, ummm
Whoa now? Think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me, mmm, mmm

She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh no)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh please)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (no, no)
She can't help it

You know, this isn't the first time this has happened to me
This love sick thing
I like serious relationships and, uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed, and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up and bites me
And I'm back

She can't help it
The girl can't help it (in love)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh God)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (I'm back in love)
Girl can't help it
Woo, hoo, hoo
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah baby)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah)

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my best-est
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn, 
to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing 
We are just one big family
And It's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't 
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours

Hey baby girl, I've been watching you all day (all day, all day, all day)
Man that thing you got behind you is amazing (amazing, amazing, amazing)
You make me want to take you out
And let it rain (let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
I know you got a man but this is what you should say

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never looking back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G5 
And I'm leavin' never looking back again?
So call you shawty and tell him you found a new man

Now if I talk it girl,
You know that I will walk it out (walk it out, walk it out, walk it out)
Man I'll put my money (money) where my mouth is (mouth is, mouth is, mouth is)
Cause you the baddest little thing
That I've ever seen (ever seen, ever seen, ever seen)
So I'ma ask you one time if you got a man

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress

That girl is a bad girl, I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous,
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh

No matter what you say about love,
I keep coming back for more,
Keep my head in the fire,
Sooner or later I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life,
I learn every time I bleed the truth is a 
Stranger soul is in danger 
I gotta let my spirit be free, to
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment 
I realize nothing's broken 
No need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do 
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'll always have you

I'm sick of playing all of these games
Its not bout taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, 
It didn't deliver, it hurt enough to think that I could stop 
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I got to be strong and leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment 
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I love you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do 
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'll always have you

If I live every moment,
Won't change any moment,
There's still a part of me in u
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do, oh

I can't waste time so give it a moment 
I realize nothing's broken no need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're in my heart just like a tattoo

I can't waste time so give it a moment 
I realize nothing's broken no need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're in my heart just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo
I'll Always have you

I got my sights
Set on you
And I'm ready to aim
I have a heart
That will never be tamed
I knew you were
Something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait
To see you again

I've got a way
Of knowing
When something is right
I feel like
I must have known
You in another life
Cause I felt
This deep connection
When you looked
In my eyes
Now I can't wait
To see you again
The last time
I freaked out
I just kept
Looking down

I st-st-stuttered
When you asked me
What I'm thinking about
Felt like
I couldn't breath
You asked
What's wrong with me
My best friend
Lesley said
"Oh
She's just being Miley"
The next time
We hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest
Till then
Whoa whoa I
I can't wait
To see you again

I got
This crazy feeling
Deep inside
When you called
And asked
To see me
Tomorrow night
I'm not
A mind reader
But I'm reading
The signs
That you can't wait
To see me again

I got my sights
Set on you
And I'm ready
To aim

Whoa, whoa I
I can't wait
To see you again

Let's drop!
Yeah, come on
Shake, shake

I'll take you home
If you don't leave me at the front door
(Leave me at the front door)
Your body's cold
But girl, we're gettin' so warm
And I was thinking of ways
That I could get inside
(Get inside)

Tonight you're falling in love
Let me go now
This feeling's tearing me up
Here we go now

Now if she does it like this
Will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this
Will you touch her like that?
Now if she moves like this
Will you move her like that?
Come on, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake it

Shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake it

Your lips tremble
But your eyes are in a straight stare
(In a straight stare)
We're on the bed
But your clothes are laying right there
And I was thinking of places
That I could hide
(I could hide)

Tonight you're falling in love
Let me go now
This feeling's tearing me up
Here we go now

Now if she does it like this
Will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this
Will you touch her like that?
Now if she moves like this
Will you move her like that?
Come on, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake it

I saw you dancing
And I couldn't get you off my mind
I could tell that you could tell
That I was taking my time
But I was thinking of ways
To get you to stay tonight
Body's shaking
Turn me on so I can turn off the lights

Now if she does it like this
Will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this
Will you touch her like that?
Now if she moves like this
Will you move her like that?
Come on, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake it

This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years

Steady hands just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I live

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh

Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see'

They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'm gonna run till you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh

Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, you don't need

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
I've become what I can't be
Oh, do you see what I see?

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know

And you over think
Always speak
Cryptically

I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now you're plain boring

I should know that
You're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bi-polar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down.

Ey, this is special what's happenin' to all my
All my all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here,
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

(So live your life)

She my bust it baby

First time we had sex, it was like a movie
Both of us fell asleep, both of us was woozy
Love how she say my name, love how she do me
Gained feelings for her kinda quick, kinda blew me
Found myself thinking bout her, shit kinda spooked me
More time we spent together more she got attached
I love being around her, seem like the perfect match
She ain't blow my phone up and she ain't never hack
She knew her place, played her role, and she was cool with that
"What you doing", "Where you going" -- questions she don't ask
She took my mind off the streets she helped me relax
She wanted to VIP her face she put me on my back

Her sex game crazy
Body so amazing
Kiss like she craving
Walk like she taken
Attitude mistaken
Fiend for her daily
Care about her greatly
Why she my bust it baby

What we did last night got me wantin to call her
If I wasn't real homie I'd probably stalk her
From the hood, when she get drunk she talk proper
Got kinky with her, told her dress up like a lawyer
I was the judge last night I gave her all the orders
Worked it real good turned her round and doggystyled her
Told her if I gave her any more might have to charge her
Felt the vibe in the room the feelings getting larger
Took her from the bench and I done turned her to a starter
Tastes like sugar, smell like water
Now she into goons all off what I taught her
What I do to her make her care about me harder

This another one champion sound
Yeah Estelle we about to get down

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

Do-do you got a first aid kit handy
Do-do you know how to patch up a wound tell me, 
Are you patient, understanding?
Cause I might need some time to clear the hole in my heart and I
I've tried every remedy and nothing seems to work for me

Baby, this situation's driving me crazy
And I really wanna be your lady

But the one before you left me so damaged (damaged) damaged (damaged)
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged (damaged) so damaged (so damaged)
And you can blame the one before

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (Baby I gotta know, what are you gonna do)

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (Baby I gotta know, what are you gonna do)

Do-do you got a first aid kit handy
Do-do you know how to patch up a wound tell me
Are you-Are you patient, understanding?
Cause I might need some time to clear the hold on my heart and I

You try to gain my trust
Talking is not enough
Actions speak louder than words
You gotta show me something
My heart is missing some pieces
I need this puzzle put together again

Damaged (damaged) damaged (damaged)
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged (damaged) so damaged (so damaged)
And you can blame the one before

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (Baby I gotta know, what are you gonna do)

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (Baby I gotta know, what are you gonna do)

Can you fix my h-e-a-r-t
Cause it's d-a-m-a-g-e-d
Can you fix my h-e-a-r-t

Tell me are you up for the challenge
Cause my heart is damaged

Damaged (damaged) damaged (damaged)
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged (damaged) so damaged (so damaged)
And you can blame the one before

Damaged (damaged) damaged (damaged)
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged (damaged) so damaged (so damaged)
And you can blame the one before

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it

My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged

Young money
Ya dig
Mack I'm goin' in

I'm a Millionaire,
I'm a Young Money Millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair,
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair,
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Threw the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind,
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time,
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar,
And the almighty power of that cha cha cha cha chopper,
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motherfuck a copper,
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin',
Tell the coppers, ha ha ha ha you can't catch' em, you can't stop 'em,
I go by them goon rules
If you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em,
You can't man em then you mop 'em,
You can't stand em then you drop em,
You pop em cause we pop em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker I'm ill

A million here a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair with coconut derrière
Like smokin' the thinnest air I open the Lamborghini
Hopin' them crackers see me like look at dat bastard Weezy
He's a beast he's a dog he's a muthfukin' problem
OK you're a goon but what's a goon (to a goblin)
Nothin' nothin' you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some fagot bullshit call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want bitch call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private damn I hate a shy Bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch yea I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more she changed her name to my bitch
Yea nigga that's my bitch 
So when she ask for the money when you through don't be surprised bitch
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass you ain't got shit

And my knot thick

Who that one that do that boy ya knew that true the Swallow
And I be the shit now you got loose bowels
I don't O U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Then to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe look like it's poutin'
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me 
They don't see but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me I'm illi

C three three peat

Oh I have a lot to say
I was thinking on my time away
I miss you and things weren't the same
Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me want to die
I'm sorry you're bad
I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all your sounds
Baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

This time, I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame 
Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me want to die
I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm sorry I'm blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all your sounds
Baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

Every single day 
I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah, sorry!
I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm sorry I'm blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all your sounds
Baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry
I'm sorry baby
I'm sorry baby
Yeah, I'm sorry.

So every time you hold me 
Hold me like this is the last time 
Every time you kiss me 
Kiss me like you'll never see me again 
Every time you touch me 
Touch me like this is the last time 
Promise that you'll love me 
Love me like you'll never see me again

Everything that I been looking for

Oh oh oh oh oh

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see

Boys call you sexy
And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around
They screaming your name

Boys call you sexy
And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around
They screaming your name

Now I've got a confession

And I promised myself that I'd do anything
Anything at all for them to notice me

And knew that singing songs would get me this far

I was all on the
Club, sippin' some Hen, smokin' on a blunt of dro
When I peeped this lil' hoe out
I was all on the
Bar, wind drift up
Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor now
With a see-through
Dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep
And a nigga know
If I take her home, with them wide ass hips
You damn right, I'm gon' beep
So I a-
Proached the chick with the real pretty face
Big ass booty with a little bitty waist
I whisped in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?"
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shit
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck faces
But it wasn't no use for me to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

Sexual eruption (A sexual eruption)
Sexual eruption
Orgasms
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Whoa
Whoa
Sexual eruption
All the time, anytime
Sexual eruption
Whoa
Sexual eruption

I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off ya stones
And notice that that pinky ring is bright enough baby
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin' and sizin' you up baby

And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, you're so cute you don't have to say a word

See those guys wanna come treat ya right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

Always talkin' bout what you got 
Always talkin' bout what you got 
Always talkin' bout what you got 
Girl you know that you need to stop 
Always talkin' bout what you got 
Always talkin' bout what you got 
Always talkin' bout what you got 
Girl you know that you need to stop 

Girl I can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl and I can't lie
Now tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized

The way you take advantage of
Every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, you're so cute you don't have to say a word

See those guys wanna come treat ya right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

My eyes away from you girl when you get on the floor and do what you do
And everybody wanna come back to that body the kind and remind myself I'm like you
'Cause your that type to drive a man crazy will snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back he'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do once you expose that thing you do
Ya had him crawlin' on hands and knees and ya find a way to get 'em out that cheese
And why ya thinkin' you the only dude she off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' everybody know she got you but now you feel like a fool

See those guys wanna come treat ya right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and love and all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the currents slowly pulling me down
It's getting harder to breath
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this

'Cause it's not my time,
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh, I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back
All this time I've just been to blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live
Is not what we have, it's what we believe

It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But, it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a wield in me
Now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh, but I won't go

I won't go

There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be something you can see

There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see

I won't go!
No I won't go down!
Yeah.

It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Going coming
Thought I heard a knock (Whose there, no one?)
Thinking that (I deserve it)
Now I have realized
That I really didn't know

If you didn't notice
You mean everything (quickly I'm learning)
To love again (all I know is)
Imma be okay

[Chorus]
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)

How could I turn on the TV
Without something that'll would remind me
Was it all that easy?
To put aside your feeling
If I'm dreamin'
Don't want to let it (hurt my feelings)
But that's the past (i believe it)
And I know that, time will heal it

If you didn't notice
Well you mean everything (quickly I'm learning)
Oh turn up again (All I know is)
I'm be OK

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)

Since there's no more you and me (No more you and me)
This time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be (No no no no no no)
No matter how hard it is
I will be fine without you
Yes I will

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)

I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

Ah ah ah ah

Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All she wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a tell you like you told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Causes I'm a tell you like you told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)

Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a draught in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
you don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy

She used to be

She used to be the sweetest girl
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Now she like sour Amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him
Where my money at?

Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill 
(Yeah, where my money at?)
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill 
(Whoa, where my money at?)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill 
(Yeah, where my money at?)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill
(Whoa) Where my money at?

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Oh is something about
Just something about the way she move
I can't figure it out
Is something about her

Say, oh is something about
Kinda woman that want you but don't need you
Hey, I can't figure it out
Is something about her

Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicure nails just sent the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly

And she move like a boss
Do what a boss
Do, she got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Oh, the way she shine
Miss independent

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Ooh there's something about
Kinda woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her

Something ooh so sexy about
Kinda woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it, she got it (she said she got it, she got it)
No doubt, there's something about her (there's somethin' about her)

Cause she work like a boss
Play like a boss
Car and the crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And bills are payed on time, yeah
She made for a boss
Only a boss
Anything less she telling them to get lost
That's the girl that's on my mind

Her favorite thing to say, don't worry I got it
And everything she got best believe she bought it
She goin' steal my heart ain't no doubt about it, girl
You're everything I need
Said you're everything I need

Yeah, yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting
It couldn't be that we have been this way before
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind

Or I won't live to see another day
I swear its true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed
But I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossible to find

So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
I'm yours to keep

And hold onto your words
'Cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're asleep

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems,
Better put 'em in quotations

Say what you need to say 

Walking like a one man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead,
If you could only

Say what you need to say 

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You'd better know that in the end
Its better to say too much
Then never say what you need to say again

Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say

Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused, you got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight
when you need to find the strength
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time

That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)

But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did

(But I hate it) You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong

(But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)

And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh)

Sad, and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right

And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)
That's how much I need you (I need you)

And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)

And I hate that I love you so, so

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show
Oh oh oh oh

Yea, uh
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you
Did you improve on the design
Did you do something new
Well your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you, you
The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you
You come to
And then it hit me
Standing outside of heaven waiting for god to come and get me
I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules
And two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer
And too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle
I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven
The devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
And out through china
Nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five
This is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called
And they told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair
And put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim


If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause I been standing in this line
For like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown
M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song
And mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show
Oh oh oh oh

Now even though I try to play it off
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all day long
And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you

Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

Whenever we up in this bed
And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you
'Cause I can't go a night without your lovin'
Got me lookin' at this phone
Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl

Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And yes, she got me there, I said it
Somebody call the paramedics
Tell 'em to hurry up and come through

'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

Can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

Don't ever leave me, girl
I need you inside my world
I can't go a day without you
And see, nobody else will ever do
I'll never feel like I feel with you

'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

Ooh, no, no, I can't breathe
Ooh, no, no, I can't breathe
Ooh, no, no, I can't breathe, ooh, no, no
Ooh, no, no, I can't breathe
Ooh, no, no, I can't breathe

I see your dirty face
High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I'm in mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Yeah!
Wayne's world

Panties drop

Period, Like the remainder

I wish I could be
As cool as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie

Take time to realize
That your warmth is
Crashing down on me

Take time to realize
That I am on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?

But I can't spell it out for you
No, it's never gonna be that simple
No, I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'd never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other, now

Take time to realize
Oh, oh, I'm on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?

Take time to realize
This all could pass you by
Didn't I tell you?

But I can't spell it out for you
No, it's never gonna be that simple
No, I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'll never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other, but

It's not the same
No, it's never the same
If you don't feel it, too

If you meet me half way
If you would meet me half way
It could be the same for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'll never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder
Just realize what I just realized
If you just realize what I just realized

Missed out on each other now
Missed out on each other now
Realize, realize, realize, realize

I put on, I put on, I put on, I put on 
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city

When they see me off in traffic, they say "Jeezy on some other shit"
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership
Me I'm in my spaceship, thats right I work for N.a.s.a
This 7H is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security
What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate
If you want it come and get it, you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin' Out the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait

I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
Put on (east side) Put on (south side) Put on (west side) Put on

Half bag, top back,
Ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps,
You know I like it super sized
Passenger's a red-bone,
Her Weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery,
Imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus,
The realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die,
The realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli,
So I keep that glock on me
Don't get caught without one,
Comin' from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton,
Flyin' down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean,
On my way to Charlene

I put on, I put on, I put on
I put on for my city, I put on for my
I put on for my city, I put on for my city, on

I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Sure I need just at least one of Russell's nieces on
I let my nightmares go I put on,
Everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed on me
You can ask big homie, man the top so lonely
I ain't lyin', so lonely I ain't lyin'
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)
Cause every night (every night) I put on

Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)
Cause every night (every night)
Let me see what we have tonight 
I'm high as a satellite 
I see those flashin' lights

I've been waiting for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And looking for that, magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it until I let go
Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm coming alive, body and soul
And feelin' my world start to turn

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time
To be more than a name
Or a face in the crowd, I know this is the time
This is the time of my life, time of my life

Holding onto things that vanished
Into the air, left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings and all that I needed
Was there all along within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

And I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life time of my life

And I'm out on the edge of forever, ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground arms open wide face to the sun

I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time this is the time of my life, time of my life 
More than a name or a face in the crowd
This is the time, this is the time of my life, this is the time of my life.
Time of my life, time of my life

Oh?

Oh?
Hey, let's go!
Never find a love like this

We go back so far,
Swinging in your back yard,
All the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school
Oh I really liked you,
Must have been your attitude.

hat's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind.
As the years they'll roll by,
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you.
You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
Never find a love like this
Let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely,
Look at what you've shown me,
Never find a love like this

Well this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap your world around me,
Never find a love like this.

All the guys tried to take me,
You're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice.

'Cause this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep calling me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say,
I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap you all around me,
Never find a love like this.

May never find a love, love, love a love like this,
That still make me think about my middle school kiss.
I sit here in this chair and I wish
For you not to leave me now.
My friends they always told me
Not to make you my wifey,
Man they was putting you down.
And now they see we rolling,
Me and you, we strolling,
They don't wanna come around.

Let me hear you say,
You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
Never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say,
Now I'll never be lonely,
Look at what you've shown me,
Never find a love like this.

You keep calling me back to your heart.

Wrap you all around me,
Never find a love like this,

Oh, never find a love like this
Oh, never find a love like this

Oh, never find a love like this
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've show me
Never find a love like this

Oh, never find a love like this?
When this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep calling me back to your heart,
Let me hear you say,
Oh, never find a love like this.
Oh, never find a love like this

But you don't
You've got me on

And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby you turn the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby

So fast (so fast)
Cant hold myself back (back, back)
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself

And I'm trying to keep from goin' under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you

And I'm tryin' to keep from goin under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cuz' I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby

Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby

Burnin' up in the place tonight
And the brothers singing loud (and were feelin' right)
Get up and dance (don't try to fight it)
Big robs for real (and that's no lie)
Stop,drop and roll (and touch the floor, to keep from burnin' up)
More and more
I got JB with me (laying it down)
Come on boys bring the chorus around

And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeahhhh)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (come on nick)
Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby
Burnin' up,burnin' up
For you baby

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming no no no, no no
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to

Something happened for the first time deep inside
It was a rush, what a rush

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl, are we just friends?
Is there more, is there more?

See it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into something that will last
Last forever, forever

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized

'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Da da da da
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center 
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking
I must go alone
I must take the baby steps till I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine
Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers, and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

La da da da da da

Cause they got more (Ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles

Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life

Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
(I wish a nigga would)
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Having' money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good

Makes it hard, it could be easy

Womanizer, woman-womanizer
You're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

And I said,
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go

And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone 
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess 
It's a love story baby just say yes 

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby just say "Yes"

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes"

Oh, oh, 
Oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

You know I love music
And every time I hear something hot
It makes me wanna move
It makes me wanna have fun
But it's something about this joint right here
This joint right here
Its makes me wanna, wooh

Let it go
Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, going do what you want to do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we
No time for moping around, are you kidding
And no time for negative vibes, cause I'm winning
It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me 
When I'm walking past the mirror
No stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my mind right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine

Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
Keep your head up high
In yourself, believe in you, believe in me
Having a really good time, I'm not complaining
And I'm a still wear a smile if it raining
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad I got mine

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me 
When I'm walking past the mirror
Aint worried about you and what you gonna do
I'm a lady so I must stay classy
Got to keep it hot, keep it together
If I want to get better
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see I won't change my life, my life's just fine

I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
(I ain't gone let nobody bring me down, no, no, no)
No matter what nobody has to say
(No way, no way, no way)
I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
No matter what nobody has to say

Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
It's a really good thing to say
That I won't change my life, my life's just fine

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see I won't change my life, my life's just fine

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me 
When I'm walking past the mirror
No stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my mind right

See I wouldn't change my life, my life's just

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh

I got a fresh line up, fresh outfit
'Bout to have the parking lot on smash
Plus I got a Chevy with a 4-54 in the hood that bitch got 1-25 in the dash
(She like a gangsta cause)
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
Cause it's just another day in the life of a God damn boss

I don't make love baby we make magic
Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin'
Always wear plastic baby cause shit happens
She leaves the backseat just to freak in the magnum
Hopped out the magnum hopped in the tray
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight
Still in the streets strapped with them thangs
She in love with a G so she tatted my name (Ross!)
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
Ten black maybacks back to back in a lane
I'm a make it rain then I'm a make it back
You are just a lame lil' homie that's a fact
Workin' with the police actin' like ya know me
Fresh outta jail already in ya hoe's sheets

The boss, boss, boss, the boss

Shawty straight diggin' me and I ain't even rich
I know you niggas on the sideline like ain't that a bitch
I'm on my job and I ain't gettin' off
Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss

I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Got the biggest car Spanish broads no bra
Callin' otha lames for the walks in the park
I ain't come to play games I just wanna play my part
Tell ya girlfriend to come talk with my dawg
We straight G's and we came here to ball
Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you count em all
Then we off to the Chevy fire it up and takin' off
Baby slow it down cause you movin' to fast
Ya ass too fine to be movin' too fast
Back to the thuggin' now I'm sippin' sy-z-urp
All my niggas love it baby that's my w-is-ord
Stack for the jeans five bones for the sh-is-irt
I don't smoke 28? 800 for the?
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
You can tell by the shon's that's standin' by the car

Ay, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, ay
Ay, uh huh, yea, uh huh, yea, yea, yea
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far

It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait, check it out 

I see you, you wit him, he ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by, while he lies, then turn right round and forgive
I can't take, to see your face wit those tears running down yo cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true, because deep down I'm still a G

And I don't wanna come between you and your man,
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait

Till you get back wit him, it don't change (Can't help but wait)
Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same (Can't help but wait)
Till you, see you, for what you really are (Baby girl you are a star)
And I can't help but wait

It ain't fresh, to just let him call the shots
Your a queen, you should be, getting all that someones got
You should be rocking the latest, and purses, bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than an occasional "I love you", "I'm thinking of you"

And I don't wanna come between you and your man, no
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I cant help but wait

Get it together, you can do better
Seeing is believing, and I see what you need so
I'm gonna play my position, let you catch what you been missing
I'm calling out! Girl because I can't help but wait

Can't help but wait, can't help but wait, can't help but wait, no, no, no

So many people gonna say that they want you,
To try to get you thinking they really care,
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one 
Who has put in the time and you know he's gonna be there,
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it,
Don't let nobody put you down, who your with
Take the pain of protecting your name, 
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,
Someone understands,
And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) [x2]

Out the many broken back doors and windows,
Through the valley of the love of the lost,
Is a hole that is cut through the souls falling down
From the thrones without leaving any windows,
But you drown in a piece for the moment,
The moment was over in time,
Then its gone the hit and run the tactless one has a short life

Gonna tell you what you do to think you practice what you preach,
Now I know there's nothing we cant preach,
Cause the heart can't erase once it 
Finds a place to be warm and welcome,
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Who knows me better
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me

And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired
They say "You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"
So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way
Through the day
A life
For the night
Dear Lord, you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why
You haven’t taken (my life? x3)
Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3)
(My Life x3)


Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide (Suicide..suicide..)
I'm from a Windy City, like "Do or Die"
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus
Shot for no f**kin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? (My Life x3)
'Cause that's Jesus people
And The Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, "The Passion of Christ" need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (My Life x3)
I need some meditation, so I can leave my people
They askin' “Why?" Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired
They say "You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"
So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way
Through the day
A life
For the night
Dear Lord, you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why
You haven’t taken (my life? x3)
Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3)
(My Life x3)

We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution (caution...caution)
You see them 24's spinnin'? I earned them
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste, now?
And f**k Jesse Jackson cause it ain't about race, now
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (My Life x3)
Damn, I know his momma's proud
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my momma now
And like MJB, "No More Drama" now
Livin’ the +good life+, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack and niggas could drive it outta town
Gotta Chris Paul mind state, I'm never outta bounds
My life used to be empty like a glock without a round
Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds (Gunshots)

[Chorus: Lil’ Wayne]

And I’m grindin’ 'til I’m tired
They say "You ain’t grindin’ 'til you tired"
So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way
Through the day
A life
For the night
Dear Lord you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why
You haven’t taken (my life? x3)
Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3)
(My Life x3)

Walk through the gates of Hell, see my Impala parked in front
The high beams on, me and the Devil share chronic blunts
Listening to the "Chronic" album, playing backwards
Shootin’ at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherf**kers afraid of Suge (Compton... Compton...)
Made my grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy, when I bet that new Mercedes could (My Life x3)
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me, that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should (My Life x3)
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired
They say "You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"
So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way
Through the day
A life
For the night
Dear Lord you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why
You haven’t taken my life my life my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
(My Life)
(My Life)
(My Life)

Where were you,when I said I loved you
And where were you when I cried at Night
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you, I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out, I remember when I screamed I hated you
But some how deep inside I deep inside still lovin' you

Sad and lonely

No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love, I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know, where I would go, where I would be
But You made me leave, and plus my heart it just, it just kept telling me so oh

I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you

I remember when I walked out, I remember when I said I hated you
But some how deep inside still loving you

Flashing lights, lights

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazi

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it's been a while
Sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay
A-bay lately you been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Rodney king baby yeah I beat it like a cop
Ha ha, beat it like a cop
Rodney King baby said beat it like a cop
But I ain't try'na be violent
But I'll do the time but her love is timeless
Mrs. Officer
I know you wish ya name was Mrs. Carter huh?
Wee ooh wee ooh wee,
Wee ooh wee ooh wee (yeah)
Wee ooh wee ooh wee, like a cop car

Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya
I'm kid kid, my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold ya
My hands so big you thought I told ya to pull it over
She pulled me over, pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer, do me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off
(all you heard on the dispatcher was)
Wee ooh wee ooh wee,
Wee ooh wee ooh wee,
Wee ooh wee ooh wee

When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thing, I'll make that body sang
I make it say

Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key,
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
Cause it's on tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head,
And I can't wait to get it on
Wanna do it all night long, Mrs. Officer

Sha, sha, sha

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear
My dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and it's silent
As I wait for you to say 
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

Compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

Sha, sha, you do, oh

She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying "I can't wait to turn eighteen"
She said "I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules"
Momma put the car in park out there in front of the school
She kissed her head and said "I was just like you"

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her "It's a nice place"
She says "It'll do for now"
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head and says "Baby, just slow down"

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Five years later there's a plumber workin' on the water heater
Dog's barkin', phone's ringin'
One kid's cryin', one kid's screamin'
She keeps apologizin'
He says "They don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's thirty six, one's twenty three
Huh, it's hard to believe, but

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

You're gonna' miss this
Yeah
You're gonna' miss this

A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me wanna run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I, never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink, to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But, love remains the same

Find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city bus sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I have to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me now
We shall overcome
So all that's left is praying

But we, should have had the sun
We could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I, never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink, to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I, oh I,
I wish this could last forever
I, oh I,
as if we could last forever

Love remains the same
Love remains the same

You, you got me
Thinking it'll be all right you, you told me
"Come and take a look inside."
You believed me, in every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight, tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right

And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave, I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever-changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we could be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me girl

(oooohh ooh whoahh!)
(oooohh ooh whoahh!)
(fade) 

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

Oh girl lets take it slow
So as for you well you know where to go
I want to take my love
And hate you till the end

It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away

Yeah

I know when it's getting rough
All the times we spend
Trying to make
This love something better than
Just making up again

It's not like you to turn away
All the bullshit I can't take
Just when I think I can walk away,

I'm so addicted to all the things
You do when you're going on me
In between the sheets
All the sounds you make
With every breathe
It's unlike anything

I'm so addicted to the things you do
When you're going down on me
All the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything when you're loving me

When you're loving me

How can I make it through
All the things you do
There's just got to be more to you and me

I'm so addicted to all the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
All the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
It's unlike anything

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me

All the sounds you make
With every breath You take
It's unlike anything
I'm so addicted to you
Addicted to you

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, like it saved me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see how the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands and we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on her face
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes
The room left them moving between you and I
We forgot where we were, and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night, and we sang

And we danced on into the night

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, like it saved me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see 
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with there hands, and we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, and the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night, ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night (And the voices rang like the angels sing)
Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh, and we danced on into the night, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh) Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh) Singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh) And we danced on into the night

Sent from heaven.
Sent from heaven.

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to,
Don't feel as good as it used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Oh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help all your love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

[Chorus]
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who believes when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who believes when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What the fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Loving what you thought that could've been.
I don't wanna swing your change
When you don't feel as good as you used to (before)
And everything you used to say,
Everything you used to do clear right out the door

Oh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you

But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help all your love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

Everybody say
I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one (sent from heaven)

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who believes when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
